      "toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \n",
      "could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \n",
      "Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \n",

      "that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \n",
      "stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \n",
      "guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \n",

      "I am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \n",
      "just have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\n",
      "parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \n",

      "Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \n",
      "been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \n",
      "ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \n",
      "left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \n",
      "Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \n",

      "a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \n",

      "could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\n",
      "know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \n",
      "guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\n",
      "Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\n",
      "only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \n",
      "seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \n",

      "us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\n",
      "stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \n",
      "General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \n",
      "cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \n",
      "the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\n",
      "as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \n",
      "he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \n",
      "by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \n",
      "because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \n",
      "and he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\n",
      "horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \n",
      "punished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \n",
      "throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n",
      "\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \n",
      "to calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \n",
      "investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \n",
      "must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \n",
      "who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \n",
      "someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \n",
      "you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \n",
      "lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \n",
      "about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \n",
      "later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \n",
      "can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \n",
      "names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\n",
      "information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \n",
      "necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \n",
      "gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \n",
      "the information into the urn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \n",
      "people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \n",
      "came up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \n",

      "her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\n",
      "everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \n",
      "it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \n",
      "information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \n",
      "can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \n",

      "45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \n",

      "I say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \n",

      "wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \n",

Para cada uno de los documentos analizados se calculó el porcentaje de los 5 más similares que poseen el mismo target que el documento analizado. En sucesivas pruebas se observó que a veces dicho porcentaje fue inferior al 50%, lo que sugiere que la técnica de vectorización empleada podría ser mejorada."
