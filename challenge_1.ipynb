      "two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \n",
      "national deficit and to increase our investment in the American \n",
      "people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \n",
      "plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \n",
      "and opportunity in the country.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \n",
      "which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \n",
      "the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \n",
      "of a majority of the United States Senate. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \n",
      "the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \n",
      "fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \n",
      "Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \n",
      "have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \n",
      "the will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \n",
      "state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \n",
      "is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \n",
      "for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \n",
      "care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \n",
      "the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \n",
      "table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \n",
      "dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \n",
      "families and drawing a paycheck.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \n",
      "serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \n",
      "economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \n",
      "with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \n",
      "of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \n",
      "plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \n",
      "jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \n",
      "national needs.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \n",
      "Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \n",
      "size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \n",
      "the American people. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \n",
      "will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \n",
      "minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \n",
      "the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \n",
      "dramatic rise in violent crime. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \n",
      "additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \n",
      "to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \n",
      "fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \n",
      "matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n",
      "10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \n",
      "communities all across our nation.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \n",
      "violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \n",
      "people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \n",
      "homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \n",
      "America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \n",
      "investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \n",
      "the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \n",
      "mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \n",
      "ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \n",
      "for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \n",
      "and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \n",
      "that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \n",
      "rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \n",
      "summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \n",
      "talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \n",
      "concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \n",
      "to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \n",
      "a brighter and more peaceful future.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \n",
      "law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \n",
      "these communities.  I have always supported community policing not \n",
      "only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \n",
      "but because it cements better relationships between people in law \n",
      "enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \n",
      "the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \n",
      "chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \n",
      "I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \n",
      "another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \n",
      "years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \n",
      "the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \n",
      "jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \n",
      "you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \n",
      "the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \n",
      "building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \n",
      "create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \n",
      "part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \n",
      "the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \n",

      "I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \n",
      "a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \n",
      "people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \n",

      "I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \n",
      "first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \n",

      "\t     \n",

      "poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \n",
      "country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \n",
      "even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \n",
      "efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \n",
      "officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \n",

      "\t     \n",

      "country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \n",
      "the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \n",

      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \n",
      "of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \n",
      "me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \n",
      "economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \n",
      "gives the country a very different budget for the next five years \n",
      "than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \n",
      "at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \n",
      "health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \n",
      "short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \n",
      "to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \n",
      "to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \n",
      "to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \n",
      "plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \n",
      "Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \n",
      "bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \n",
      "to a vote.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \n",
      "for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \n",
      "leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \n",
      "stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \n",
      "the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \n",
      "targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \n",
      "this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \n",
      "years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \n",
      "economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \n",
      "are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \n",
      "billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\n",
      "much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \n",
      "I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \n",
      "think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \n",
      "right now to show that we're changing the direction of the \n",
      "country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \n",
      "his office lately?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \n",
      "regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \n",
      "operation to the senators that we think are open to this --\n",
      "Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \n",
      "from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \n",
      "others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \n",
      "know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \n",
      "of the budget I presented.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \n",
      "got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \n",
      "is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \n",
      "of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \n",
      "have this program well below the spending targets that Congress \n",
      "has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \n",
      "years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \n",
      "voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \n",
      "putting the American people back to work.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \n",

      "the need for jobs.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  I have some questions from people who supported \n",
      "you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \n",
      "It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \n",
      "of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \n",
      "think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \n",
      "White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \n",
      "through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \n",
      "they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \n",

      "very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \n",
      "fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \n",

      "fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \n",

      "\t     \n",
      "\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \n",
      "state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \n",
      "is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \n",
      "for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \n",
      "care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \n",

      "serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \n",
      "economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \n",
      "with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \n",
      "of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \n",
      "plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \n",
      "jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \n",
      "national needs.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \n",
      "Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \n",

      "the American people. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \n",
      "will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \n",

      "the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \n",
      "dramatic rise in violent crime. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \n",
      "additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \n",
      "to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \n",
      "fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \n",

      "homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \n",

      "\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \n",
      "law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \n",
      "these communities.  I have always supported community policing not \n",
      "only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \n",
      "but because it cements better relationships between people in law \n",
      "enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \n",
      "the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \n",
      "chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \n",
      "I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \n",

    "Se tomaron los 5 términos más similares a cada uno de 5 términos elegidos al azar. Se usó como métrica la distancia del coseno y a TF-IDF como técnica de vectorización. En sucesivas pruebas se observó que no existe semejanza semántica entre los términos comparados. Esto es esperable dada la técnica de vectorización empleada. TF-IDF no capta el significado semántico de las palabras y no considera el contexto en el que las mismas figuran. Palabras como \"silla\" y \"asiento\", por ejemplo, podrían tener vectores no cercanos en función de las diferentes frencuencias con las que estas palabras puedan aparecer en un determinado corpus. Distinto habría sido el resultado de haber usado word embeddings sobre un corpus suficientemente rico."
