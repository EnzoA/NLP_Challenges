      "that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \n",

      "family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \n",

      "wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\n",
      "the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \n",

      "\n",
      "At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \n",

      "off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \n",
      "there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \n",
      "first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n",
      "\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \n",
      "don't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \n",
      "it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \n",
      "he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \n",
      "her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \n",
      "down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \n",
      "balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \n",
      "blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \n",
      "from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\n",
      "of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\n",
      "I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\n",
      "that woman, because I had just seen that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \n",

      "\n",
      "But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \n",
      "came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \n",
      "upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \n",
      "balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \n",
      "though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \n",
      "and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \n",
      "and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \n",
      "time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \n",
      "morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \n",

      "too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\n",
      "garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \n",
      "toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \n",
      "could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \n",
      "Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \n",

      "months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \n",
      "earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \n",
      "and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\n",

      "could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\n",
      "know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \n",
      "guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\n",
      "Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\n",

      "these women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \n",
      "tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\n",
      "already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \n",
      "cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \n",
      "the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \n",
      "it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \n",
      "were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\n",
      "to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\n",
      "that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \n",
      "was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \n",

      "advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n",
      "\n",

      "tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\n",
      "Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\n",
      "hand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\n",

      "what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \n",
      "traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \n",
      "yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \n",
      "very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \n",
      "expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \n",
      "did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\n",
      "you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\n",
      "to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\n",
      "already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\n",
      "them?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \n",
      "he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \n",
      "and hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \n",
      "didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \n",
      "Muslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\n",
      "guilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \n",
      "us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \n",
      "raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \n",
      "carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \n",
      "then?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \n",
      "anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \n",
      "laughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \n",
      "know what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \n",
      "you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \n",
      "front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \n",
      "over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \n",
      "during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\n",
      "either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \n",
      "away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \n",
      "excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \n",
      "you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \n",
      "That's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \n",
      "party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \n",
      "they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \n",
      "impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \n",
      "days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \n",

      "arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\n",
      "the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \n",
      "asked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \n",
      "us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\n",
      "stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \n",
      "General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \n",
      "cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \n",
      "the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\n",
      "as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \n",
      "he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \n",
      "by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \n",
      "because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \n",
      "and he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\n",
      "horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \n",
      "punished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \n",
      "throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n",
      "\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \n",
      "to calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \n",
      "investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \n",
      "must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \n",
      "who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \n",
      "someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \n",
      "you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \n",
      "lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \n",
      "about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \n",
      "later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \n",
      "can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \n",
      "names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\n",
      "information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \n",
      "necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \n",
      "gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \n",
      "the information into the urn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \n",
      "people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \n",
      "came up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \n",
      "will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \n",
      "please write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\n",
      "her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\n",
      "everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \n",
      "it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \n",
      "information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \n",
      "can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \n",

      "its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\n",

      "\n",
      "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\n",
      "but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\n",
      "hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",
      "     exist.\n",
      "  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n",
      "  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n",
      "assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n",
      "the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n",
      "considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n",
      "information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n",
      "can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n",
      "information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n",
      "no \"cost\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n",
      "problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n",
      "Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n",
      "argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n",
      "to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n",
      "intended the argument to be viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n",
      "omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n",
      "a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n",
      "whether people believe in him.\n",

      "\n",
      "William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \n",

      "1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\n",

      "\n",
      "2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \n",
      "there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \n",
      "of non-zero complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \n",
      "that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n",

      "against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\n",
      "weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\n",
      "Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\n",

      "ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\n",

      "insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\n",
      "federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\n",

      "an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\n",

      "The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\n",
      "in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\n",
      "permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\n",

      "\n",
      "     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\n",

      "she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\n",
      "implementation of the decision.\n",

      "     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\n",

      "captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\n",

      "     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\n",

      "that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\n",
      "step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\n",
      "described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\n",
      "to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\n",
      "permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\n",
      "very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\n",
      "hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\n",
      "people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\n",
      "shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\n",
      "there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\n",
      "lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\n",
      "There were no shots coming back from the government side.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\n",
      "asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\n",
      "I was given were the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\n",
      "federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\n",
      "quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\n",
      "needed in other parts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\n",
      "never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\n",
      "that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\n",
      "be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\n",
      "members to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\n",
      "to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\n",
      "the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\n",
      "the children who were still inside the compound were being abused\n",
      "significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\n",
      "unsafe conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\n",
      "The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\n",
      "given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\n",
      "evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\n",
      "that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\n",
      "convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\n",
      "increase with the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The third question I asked was, has the military been\n",
      "consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\n",
      "that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\n",
      "that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\n",
      "people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\n",
      "of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\n",
      "military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\n",
      "had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\n",
      "minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n",
      "-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\n",
      "significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\n",
      "said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\n",
      "should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\n",
      "today.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Mr. President --\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\n",
      "reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\n",
      "trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\n",
      "add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\n",
      "late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\n",
      "had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\n",
      "custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\n",
      "to unfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\n",
      "speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\n",
      "on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\n",
      "I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\n",
      "King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\n",
      "is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\n",
      "happen when the federal government is in control.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\n",
      "would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\n",
      "Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\n",
      "murdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\n",
      "life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\n",
      "people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\n",
      "heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\n",
      "and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\n",
      "avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\n",
      "themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\n",
      "is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\n",
      "to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\n",
      "you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\n",
      "said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\n",
      "children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\n",
      "unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\n",
      "with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\n",
      "that.  So that is where I think things stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\n",
      "mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\n",
      "patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\n",
      "decide that way?\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\n",
      "is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\n",
      "done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\n",
      "time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\n",
      "World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\n",
      "to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\n",
      "should have known?  Is there some other question they should have\n",
      "asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\n",
      "for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\n",
      "the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\n",
      "the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\n",
      "some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\n",
      "totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\n",
      "evidence we have.\n",

      "fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\n",
      "again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\n",
      "particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\n",

      "early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\n",

Para cada uno de los documentos analizados se calculó el porcentaje de los 5 más similares que poseen el mismo target que el documento analizado. En sucesivas pruebas se observó que a veces dicho porcentaje fue inferior al 50%, lo que sugiere que la técnica de vectorización empleada podría ser mejorada."
