      "physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \n",
      "an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\n",
      "ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \n",
      "went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \n",
      "was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\n",
      "tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \n",
      "want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \n",
      "silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\n",
      "me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\n",
      "one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \n",
      "telling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \n",
      "her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\n",
      "handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \n",
      "apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \n",
      "walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \n",
      "There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \n",
      "went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\n",
      "apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \n",
      "cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \n",
      "doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \n",
      "opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \n",
      "Sabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He \n",
      "knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \n",
      "Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \n",
      "apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\n",
      "delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\n",
      "All of my family had gathered there.\n",
      "   \n",
      "At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\n",
      "apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \n",
      "Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \n",
      "you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\n",
      "her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \n",
      "side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \n",
      "cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\n",
      "microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \n",
      "afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \n",
      "to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\n",
      "bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \n",
      "that was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \n",
      "my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\n",
      "tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \n",
      "little golden one . . . \" She understood me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \n",
      "She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \n",
      "understand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \n",
      "glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \n",
      "forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \n",
      "to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\n",
      "saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \n",
      "and paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \n",
      "can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \n",
      "something, but she couldn't. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\n",
      "then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\n",
      "\"Maybe it'll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\n",
      "control myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\n",
      "a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \n",
      "says, \"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \n",
      "damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\n",
      "to call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \n",
      "understood her every word. I ask, \"What's his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \n",
      "that's the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \n",
      "But I didn't know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what's his number?\" She \n",
      "says, \"I can't remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \n",
      "says, \"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \n",
      "crying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \n",
      "we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \n",
      "who can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn't \n",
      "answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \n",
      "found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \n",
      "was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n",
      "\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \n",
      "tell them that they just can't do that.\" She still didn't know what was really\n",
      "going on. I said, \"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \n",
      "happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \n",
      "Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \n",
      "that we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it's that serious \n",
      ". . . \" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \n",
      "and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \"OK, \n",
      "fine, fine,\" she says, \"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \n",
      "I'll send him over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \n",
      "under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \n",
      "wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \n",
      "everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\n",
      "trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \n",
      "finally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \n",
      "place now.\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \n",
      "because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \n",
      "with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \n",
      "shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \n",
      "grown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\n",
      "went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \n",
      "first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\n",
      "soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\n",
      "that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\n",
      "fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\n",
      "first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\n",
      "eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \n",
      "saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n",
      ". . . everything just like a war.\n",
      "\n",
      "They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\n",
      "people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \n",
      "Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \n",
      "she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \n",
      "Arkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \n",
      "started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \n",
      "when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \n",
      "sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \n",
      "started to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\n",
      "have they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \n",
      "she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \n",
      "Mamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \n",
      "are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\n",
      "and you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \n",
      "there. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \n",
      "daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \n",
      "drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\n",
      "doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \n",
      "and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \n",
      "out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \n",
      "don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \n",
      "the matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\n",
      "in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\n",
      "I said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \n",
      "the doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \n",
      "Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \n",
      "sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \n",
      "she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \n",
      "be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\n",
      "her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \n",
      "wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \n",
      "something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \n",
      "dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \n",
      "I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \n",
      "know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\n",
      "I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \n",
      "very familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n",
      "\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \n",
      "brought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \n",
      "just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n",
      "\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \n",
      "taking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \n",
      "sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \n",
      "up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \n",
      "remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\n",
      "did to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \n",
      "Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \n",
      "learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \n",
      "didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \n",
      "to kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \n",
      "balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \n",
      "two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \n",
      "against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\n",
      "with his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \n",
      "what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \n",
      "he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\n",
      "third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \n",
      "Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\n",
      "were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \n",
      "someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \n",
      "yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\n",
      "I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \n",
      "and said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \n",
      "father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \n",
      "that he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \n",
      "probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\n",
      "job.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \n",
      "I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \n",
      "to his apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \n",
      "doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \n",
      "wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\n",
      "surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\n",
      "Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\n",
      "coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\n",
      "having examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \n",
      "they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n",
      "\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\n",
      "would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \n",
      "story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \n",
      "drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\n",
      "found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\n",
      "they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \n",
      "zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \n",
      "seeing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \n",
      "any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \n",
      "place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \n",
      "her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\n",
      "Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\n",
      "When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \n",
      "involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\n",
      "Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \n",
      "when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\n",
      "you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \n",
      "wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \n",
      "would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \n",
      "was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \n",
      "every day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \n",
      "explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \n",
      "children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \n",
      "pleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\n",
      "would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \n",
      "because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\n",
      "as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \n",
      "of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \n",
      "victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\n",
      "they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\n",
      "themselves said that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \n",
      "people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \n",
      "why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \n",
      "maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \n",
      "they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \n",
      "nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \n",
      "Marina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \n",
      "there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \n",
      "shouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \n",
      "happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \n",
      "hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\n",
      "happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\n",
      "ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\n",
      "thought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\n",
      "I do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\n",
      "it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \n",
      "That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \n",
      "course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\n",
      "of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\n",
      "together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\n",
      "present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\n",
      "when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\n",
      "First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \n",
      "the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \n",
      "There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \n",
      "there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \n",
      "were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \n",
      "and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\n",
      "There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\n",
      "They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\n",
      "that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\n",
      "so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\n",
      "The women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\n",
      "better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\n",
      "had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \n",
      "have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \n",
      "They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \n",
      "could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \n",
      "police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \n",
      "surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \n",
      "standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \n",
      "great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \n",
      "just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\n",
      "or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \n",
      "family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \n",
      "when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\n",
      "person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\n",
      "have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \n",
      "room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\n",
      "one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \n",
      "people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\n",
      "the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \n",
      "hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \n",
      "parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \n",
      "attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \n",
      "Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \n",
      "she wouldn't be able to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \n",
      "climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\n",
      "They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \n",
      "calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \n",
      "little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\n",
      "to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \n",
      "have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \n",
      "do eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \n",
      "were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \n",
      "the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \n",
      "different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \n",
      "and calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \n",
      "over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \n",
      "sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \n",
      "soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\n",
      "standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\n",
      "to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \n",
      "him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \n",
      "one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \n",
      "doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \n",
      "muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\n",
      "appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\n",
      "was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \n",
      "terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \n",
      "creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \n",
      "this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \n",
      "went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n",
      "\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \n",
      "raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \n",
      "nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \n",
      "one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \n",
      "could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \n",
      "many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\n",
      "after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \n",
      "elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \n",
      "There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \n",
      "The situation was deplorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \n",
      "Azerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\n",
      "and put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \n",
      "either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \n",
      "dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \n",
      "family,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \n",
      "the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\n",
      "spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\n",
      "machine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\n",
      "I'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\n",
      "them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\n",
      "moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \n",
      "here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\n",
      "This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\n",
      "places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\n",
      "SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \n",
      "asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\n",
      "I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\n",
      "Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\n",
      "assured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\n",
      "there is capable of anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\n",
      "already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\n",
      "tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\n",
      "we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \n",
      "acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \n",
      "hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \n",
      "them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \n",
      "come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \n",
      "they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \n",
      "hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \n",
      "course the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \n",
      "him!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \n",
      "what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \n",
      "well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \n",
      "room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \n",
      "talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \n",
      "of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \n",
      "Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \n",
      "from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \n",
      "him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \n",
      "soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \n",
      "the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \n",
      "two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \n",
      "lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \n",
      "who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \n",
      "had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \n",
      "Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \n",
      "alive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \n",
      "them to continue what I was doing and went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\n",
      "father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\n",
      "Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \n",
      "name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \n",
      "that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\n",
      "of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \n",
      "it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\n",
      "somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \n",
      "Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \n",
      "in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \n",
      "missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n",
      "\n",
      "All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \n",
      "contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \n",
      "of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \n",
      "going on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\n",
      "they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n",
      "[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\n",
      "of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\n",
      "him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\n",
      "was one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\n",
      "should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\n",
      "again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\n",
      "was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\n",
      "that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \n",
      "people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \n",
      "a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\n",
      "remember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\n",
      "were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\n",
      "don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \n",
      "whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\n",
      "the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \n",
      "people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\n",
      "in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \n",
      "Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \n",
      "there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \n",
      "Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \n",
      "cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \n",
      "to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\n",
      "the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \n",
      "Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\n",
      "more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \n",
      "drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\n",
      "don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \n",
      "publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \n",
      "they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\n",
      "is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n",
      "8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \n",
      "her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \n",
      "Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \n",
      "same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \n",
      "the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \n",
      "when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \n",
      "braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \n",
      "they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n",
      ". . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\n",
      "days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \n",
      "and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \n",
      "it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \n",
      "already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \n",
      "social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n",
      "\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\n",
      "and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \n",
      "and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \n",
      "although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \n",
      "dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \n",
      "was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\n",
      "to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\n",
      "visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\n",
      "Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \n",
      "only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\n",
      "Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \n",

      "record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \n",
      "We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\n",
      "conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \n",
      "quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \n",
      "weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \n",
      "curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \n",
      "video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \n",
      "we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \n",
      "to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\n",
      "that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \n",
      "Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \n",
      "Bibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \n",
      "months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\n",

      "He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\n",
      "gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\n",
      "her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\n",
      "self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\n",
      "rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\n",
      "and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\n",
      "were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \n",
      "this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\n",
      "not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\n",
      "investigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\n",
      "was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\n",
      "ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\n",
      "cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\n",
      "every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\n",

      "Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \n",

      "who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \n",
      "loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \n",
      "his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \n",
      "sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \n",
      "even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \n",
      "continue looking for him.\n",

      "The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \n",

      "one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\n",
      "Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\n",

      "of me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\n",
      "simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\n",
      "a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\n",

      "though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\n",
      "pressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\n",
      "Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\n",
      "in short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\n",
      "pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\n",
      "that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \n",
      "in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \n",
      "all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \n",
      "them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\n",
      "from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \n",
      "Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \n",
      "boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \n",
      "been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \n",
      "enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\n",
      "even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \n",
      "take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \n",
      "slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \n",
      "Basically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \n",
      "it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \n",
      "one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \n",
      "black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\n",
      "part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \n",
      "Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\n",
      "arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \n",
      "don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \n",
      "Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \n",
      "nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \n",
      "axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \n",
      "threw them into the tub with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \n",
      "know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \n",
      "their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\n",
      "eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \n",
      "identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\n",
      "in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \n",
      "did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \n",
      "kept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \n",
      "as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \n",
      "that looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\n",
      "his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\n",
      "put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \n",
      "told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n",
      "\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \n",
      "Armenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \n",
      "asked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\n",
      "identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \n",
      "name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \n",
      "pale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\n",
      "table with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \n",
      "turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\n",
      "acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \n",
      "forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\n",
      "But he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \n",
      "me.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\n",
      "hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\n",
      "into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \n",
      "of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \n",
      "Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\n",
      "and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \n",
      "back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \n",
      "but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \n",
      "strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \n",
      "microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\n",
      "last name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n",
      "\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \n",
      "They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \n",
      "because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \n",
      "some actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\n",
      "they would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \n",
      "nothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \n",
      "emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n",
      ". . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\n",
      "you able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\n",
      "the tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \n",
      "that high in gym class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \n",
      "the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \n",
      "beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \n",
      "guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\n",
      "them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n",
      "\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\n",
      "o'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \n",
      "we'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\n",
      "had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \n",
      "motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \n",
      "out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\n",
      "the Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n",
      "\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \n",
      "him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\n",
      "in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \n",
      "we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\n",
      "beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\n",
      "was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\n",
      "him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\n",
      "of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \n",
      "apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \n",
      "apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \n",
      "don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\n",
      "out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\n",
      "because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\n",
      "courtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\n",
      "I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \n",
      "have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\n",
      "and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\n",
      "with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\n",
      "call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\n",
      "someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \n",
      "understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\n",
      "they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\n",
      "name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\n",
      "that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\n",
      "Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\n",
      "level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\n",
      "work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \n",
      "crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \n",
      "promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\n",
      "So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \n",
      "promised us apartments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\n",
      "heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \n",
      "children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \n",
      "the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \n",
      "have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \n",
      "grandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\n",
      "I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \n",
      "own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\n",
      "kept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \n",
      "right before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \n",
      "marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \n",
      "have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\n",
      "grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \n",
      "to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \n",
      "knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \n",
      "himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \n",
      "Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\n",
      "enough blood here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \n",
      "that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\n",
      "and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \n",
      "liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \n",
      "Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \n",
      "old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \n",
      "the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \n",
      "already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\n",
      "and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \n",
      "sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \n",
      "woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \n",
      "Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\n",
      "The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \n",
      "and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \n",
      "he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \n",
      "floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\n",
      "custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\n",
      "But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \n",
      "tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \n",
      "have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \n",
      "events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \n",
      "about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \n",
      "without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \n",
      "have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\n",
      "let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \n",
      "nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \n",
      "a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\n",
      "what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\n",
      "unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \n",
      "threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\n",
      "to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\n",
      "February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \n",
      "who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\n",
      "for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\n",
      "as far away as their legs would carry them.\n",
      "\n",
      "February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \n",
      "into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \n",
      "been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \n",
      "a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \n",
      "teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \n",
      "seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \n",
      "were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \n",
      "evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \n",
      "the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \n",
      "microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \n",
      "driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\n",
      "child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\n",
      "seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\n",
      "be killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \n",
      "people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \n",
      "woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \n",
      "cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \n",
      "was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \n",
      "direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \n",
      "very nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \n",
      "he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \n",
      "stormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \n",
      "territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \n",
      "heart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \n",
      "territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \n",
      "From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\n",
      "time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \n",
      "the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \n",
      "Armenians.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\n",
      "Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \n",
      "the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\n",
      "that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\n",
      "teachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \n",
      "spouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \n",
      "listened to the woman's speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \n",
      "subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\n",
      "studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\n",
      "had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \n",
      "obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n",
      "\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \n",
      "they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \n",
      "tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \n",
      "said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \n",
      "second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\n",
      "after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n",
      "\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \n",
      "twelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \n",
      "kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \n",
      "children at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\n",
      "turned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \n",
      "Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\n",
      "nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \n",
      "much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \n",
      "off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \n",
      "wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \n",
      "the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\n",
      "again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \n",
      "television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \n",
      "day. That's how it all was.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\n",
      "Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \n",
      "on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \n",
      "doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \n",
      "held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \n",
      "ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \n",
      "out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \n",
      "entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \n",
      "there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \n",
      "moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \n",
      "injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \n",
      "and their children: any way they could. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \n",
      "Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \n",
      "what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \n",
      "another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \n",
      "with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \n",
      "their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \n",
      "them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \n",
      "electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \n",
      "they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \n",
      "Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\n",
      "and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \n",
      "escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \n",
      "course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\n",
      "thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \n",
      "Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \n",
      "personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\n",
      "led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \n",
      "personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \n",
      "very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \n",
      "strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \n",
      "strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \n",
      "for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \n",
      "people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \n",
      "dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \n",
      "with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \n",
      "Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \n",
      "put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \n",
      "infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \n",
      "neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \n",
      "came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \n",
      "basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\n",
      "carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \n",
      "as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \n",
      "took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \n",
      "seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \n",
      "of ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \n",
      "themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\n",
      "Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \n",
      "reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \n",
      "victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \n",
      "In the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \n",
      "the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \n",
      "important, the truth will come out regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \n",
      "bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \n",
      "years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \n",
      "become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\n",
      "that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\n",
      "received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \n",
      "will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \n",
      "Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\n",
      "tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \n",
      "the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\n",
      "speaking our native tongue.\n",

      "I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \n",

      "Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \n",

      "there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\n",

      "exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\n",
      "me, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\n",
      "another question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \n",

      "\n",
      "And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \n",

      "concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \n",
      "But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \n",
      "horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\n",
      "progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\n",
      "or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \n",

      "For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \n",

      "the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \n",

      "were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \n",
      "and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \n",
      "turned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\n",
      "Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \n",
      "returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \n",
      "neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \n",
      "middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \n",
      "were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\n",
      "honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \n",
      "I said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n",
      "\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\n",
      "smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \n",
      "that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \n",
      "the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n",
      "\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\n",

      "\n",
      "While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\n",
      "is the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \n",
      "there.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \n",
      "already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \n",
      "family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \n",
      "don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \n",
      "husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \n",
      "There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \n",
      "were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \n",
      "wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\n",
      "the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \n",
      "beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \n",
      "the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \n",
      "television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \n",
      "us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \n",
      "have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \n",
      "Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \n",
      "and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \n",
      "off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \n",
      "there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \n",
      "first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n",
      "\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \n",
      "don't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \n",
      "it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \n",
      "he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \n",
      "her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \n",
      "down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \n",
      "balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \n",
      "blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \n",
      "from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\n",
      "of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\n",
      "I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\n",
      "that woman, because I had just seen that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \n",
      "let them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \n",
      "defended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \n",
      "only Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \n",
      "came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \n",
      "upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \n",
      "balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \n",
      "though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \n",
      "and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \n",
      "and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \n",
      "time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \n",
      "morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \n",
      "Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \n",
      "too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\n",
      "garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \n",
      "toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \n",
      "could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \n",
      "Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \n",
      "they answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \n",
      "the second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \n",
      "have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \n",
      "talking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\n",
      "her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \n",
      "seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \n",
      "and left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \n",
      "I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \n",
      "really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \n",
      "floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \n",
      "months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \n",
      "earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \n",
      "and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\n",
      "everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \n",
      "out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \n",
      "the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \n",
      "hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \n",
      "that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \n",
      "be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \n",
      "foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \n",
      "apartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \n",
      "over their apartments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \n",
      "came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \n",
      "Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \n",
      "knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \n",
      "Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \n",
      "bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \n",
      "no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \n",
      "all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\n",
      "went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \n",
      "had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \n",
      "Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\n",
      "joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \n",
      "the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \n",
      "the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \n",
      "people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \n",
      "the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \n",
      "having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \n",
      "thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \n",
      "If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \n",
      "and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \n",
      "calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\n",
      "he could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \n",
      "Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \n",
      "neighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \n",
      "controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \n",
      "mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \n",
      "shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \n",
      "noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \n",
      "brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \n",
      "saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \n",
      "us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \n",
      "it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \n",
      "what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\n",
      "The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \n",
      "I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \n",
      "were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\n",
      "from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \n",
      "o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\n",
      "hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \n",
      "When they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \n",
      "police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \n",
      "going to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \n",
      "authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \n",
      "ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\n",
      "beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\n",
      "and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \n",
      "it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \n",
      "Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \n",
      "attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\n",
      "soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\n",
      "is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\n",
      "I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \n",
      "from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \n",
      "wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \n",
      "that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \n",
      "stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \n",
      "guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \n",
      "the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \n",
      "Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \n",
      "involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\n",
      "truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \n",
      "years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \n",
      "me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\n",
      "some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\n",
      "outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \n",
      "Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\n",
      "or the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \n",
      "out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \n",
      "something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \n",
      "brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\n",
      "much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \n",
      "the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\n",

      "instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \n",

      "And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\n",

      "involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \n",
      "the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \n",
      "about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \n",
      "if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \n",

      "Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\n",

      "Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\n",

      "When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \n",
      "Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\n",
      "But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \n",

      "According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\n",
      "same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\n",
      "through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\n",

      "just have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\n",
      "parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \n",

      "Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \n",
      "been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \n",
      "ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \n",
      "left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \n",
      "Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \n",
      "straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\n",
      "been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\n",
      "his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \n",
      "them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \n",
      "a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \n",
      "kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \n",
      "there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n",

      "When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \n",
      "throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \n",
      "these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\n",
      "when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\n",
      "you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \n",
      "things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \n",
      "were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \n",
      "that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \n",

      "some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\n",
      "of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\n",
      "point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\n",
      "so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\n",
      "around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\n",
      "with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \n",
      "don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \n",
      "I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \n",
      "not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \n",
      "were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \n",
      "single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \n",
      "all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \n",
      "anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\n",
      "could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\n",
      "know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \n",
      "guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\n",
      "Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\n",
      "only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \n",
      "seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \n",
      "you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \n",

      "Armenian?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\n",

      "the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\n",
      "When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \n",
      "couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\n",
      "mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \n",
      "did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \n",
      "these women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \n",
      "tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\n",
      "already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \n",
      "cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \n",
      "the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \n",
      "it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \n",
      "were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\n",
      "to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\n",
      "that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \n",
      "was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \n",
      "personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \n",
      "advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \n",
      "tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\n",
      "Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\n",
      "hand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\n",
      "I told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \n",
      "what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \n",
      "traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \n",
      "yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \n",
      "very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \n",
      "expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \n",
      "did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\n",
      "you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\n",
      "to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\n",
      "already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\n",
      "them?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \n",
      "he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \n",
      "and hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \n",
      "didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \n",
      "Muslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\n",
      "guilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \n",
      "us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \n",
      "raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \n",
      "carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \n",
      "then?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \n",
      "anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \n",
      "laughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \n",
      "know what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \n",
      "you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \n",
      "front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \n",
      "over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \n",
      "during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\n",
      "either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \n",
      "away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \n",
      "excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \n",
      "you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \n",
      "That's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \n",
      "party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \n",
      "they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \n",
      "impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \n",
      "days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \n",
      "have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \n",
      "Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \n",
      "them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\n",
      "the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\n",
      "arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\n",
      "the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \n",
      "asked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \n",
      "us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\n",
      "stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \n",
      "General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \n",
      "cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \n",
      "the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\n",
      "as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \n",
      "he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \n",
      "by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \n",
      "because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \n",
      "and he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\n",
      "horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \n",
      "punished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \n",
      "throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n",
      "\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \n",
      "to calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \n",
      "investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \n",
      "must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \n",
      "who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \n",
      "someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \n",
      "you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \n",
      "lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \n",
      "about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \n",
      "later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \n",
      "can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \n",
      "names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\n",
      "information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \n",
      "necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \n",
      "gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \n",
      "the information into the urn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \n",
      "people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \n",
      "came up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \n",
      "will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \n",
      "please write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\n",
      "her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\n",
      "everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \n",
      "it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \n",
      "information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \n",
      "can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \n",

      "government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n",
      "45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \n",

      "I say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \n",

      "  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n",

      "  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n",
      "  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n",

      "  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n",
      "  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n",
      "  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n",
      "  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n",
      "  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n",
      "  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n",

      "  against it. \n",
      "\n",
      "  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n",
      "  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n",
      "  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n",

      "  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n",

      "  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n",
      "  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n",
      "  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n",
      "  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n",
      "  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n",

      "from children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \n",
      "Vocational School. \"Don't fear,\" he said, \"it's nothing, nothing all that \n",
      "bad.\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\n",
      "broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \n",
      "When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \n",
      "there and I said, \"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \n",
      "kill us.\" And he says, \"Don't be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \n",
      "square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\n",
      "different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \"You speak\n",
      "Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\" He says \"Close the window\n",
      "and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \n",
      "closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it's\n",
      "nothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\n",
      "until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\n",
      "affecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\n",
      "too.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \n",
      "Things had calmed down slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \n",
      "get up.\" I say, \"Today's my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren't you going \n",
      "to make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \n",
      "you going?\" He says, \"I'm going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \n",
      "outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\n",
      "me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \n",
      "the car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \n",
      "the door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\n",
      "out, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\n",
      "around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\n",
      "noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n",
      "\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\n",
      "were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\n",
      "it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\n",
      "said, \"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \n",
      "standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \n",
      "they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \n",
      "o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\n",
      "o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\n",
      "and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \n",
      "I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \n",
      "don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \n",
      "it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n",
      "\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \n",
      "were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \n",
      "on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \n",
      "throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \n",
      "is shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \n",
      "television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \n",
      "on her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\n",
      "things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \n",
      "home. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \n",
      "inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \n",
      "your building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \n",
      "they said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\n",
      "our place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They've killed\n",
      "Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \n",
      "Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \n",
      "go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \n",
      "daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \n",
      "and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \n",
      "here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \n",
      "Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \n",
      "the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \n",
      "and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\n",
      "in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\n",
      "an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \n",
      "Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \n",
      "garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \n",
      "Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \n",
      "him.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \n",
      "I'm coming too.\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \n",
      "here with us, I'm go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \n",
      "Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \n",
      "then returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \n",
      "there . . . wheezing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don't go near him, \n",
      "or we'll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and \n",
      "said, \"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \n",
      "Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \n",
      "knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\n",
      "not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \n",
      "called, and called, and called--nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \n",
      "there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \n",
      "lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\n",

      "At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \n",

      "Shagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \n",
      "wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\n",
      "they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\n",
      "said, \"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\n",
      "with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\n",
      "them. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\n",
      "probably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\n",
      "and says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\" Now Shagen \n",
      "just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \n",
      "said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they've \n",
      "brought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \n",
      "dead . . . he's alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \n",
      "the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\n",
      "knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \n",
      "is it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\" \n",
      "I say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \n",
      "if not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\n",
      "office. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \n",
      "colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \n",
      "condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \n",
      "later another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \n",
      "like that there was no hope left.\n",
      "\n",
      "   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa's been killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \n",
      "I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \n",

      "are you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \n",
      "yes, that's our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor's office\n",
      "and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\n",
      "work with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\n",
      "In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\n",
      "say, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We're taking care of all that,\n",
      "don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\n",
      "spend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\n",
      "were at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\n",
      "says, \"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\n",
      "one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\n",
      "now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\n",

      "still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let's \n",

      "\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "On the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \n",
      "how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \n",
      "his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \n",

      "get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \n",
      "Sumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \n",
      "bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I'm \n",
      "shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \n",

      "arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\n",
      "they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \n",
      "anymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\n",

      "\n",
      "Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\n",
      "investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\n",
      "at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \n",
      "Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n",
      "\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you're \n",
      "describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \n",
      "\"Yes.\" \"And now you're telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \n",

      "The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\n",

      "Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \n",
      "involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\n",

      "of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \n",
      "jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What's your nationality?\" He \n",
      "says, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he's an\n",
      "Armenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\n",
      "his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n",
      ". . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \n",
      "had an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \n",
      "that's where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\n",
      "had already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\n",
      "on the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \n",
      "Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n",
      "\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\n",
      "killing someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\n",
      "not?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\n",

      "I said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \n",

      "it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \n",
      "have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\n",
      "I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven't straightened \n",

      "\n",
      "When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \n",

En sucesivas pruebas se observó que a veces dicho porcentaje fue inferior al 50%, lo que sugiere que la técnica de vectorización empleada podría ser mejorada."

    "Se tomaron los 5 términos más similares a cada uno de 5 términos elegidos al azar. Se usó como métrica la distancia del coseno y a TF-IDF como técnica de vectorización. En sucesivas pruebas se observó que no necesariamente existe semejanza semántica entre los términos comparados. Esto es esperable dada la técnica de vectorización empleada. TF-IDF no capta el significado semántico de las palabras y no considera el contexto en el que las mismas figuran. Palabras sinónimas podrían tener vectores no cercanos en función de las diferentes frencuencias con las que estas palabras puedan aparecer en un determinado corpus. Distinto habría sido el resultado de haber usado word embeddings sobre un corpus suficientemente rico."
