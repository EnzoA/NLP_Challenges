It beginswith principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field ofexperience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the sametime, insured by experience. With these principles it rises, inobedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remoteconditions. But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its laboursmust remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease topresent themselves; and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourseto principles which transcend the region of experience, while they areregarded by common sense without distrust. It thus falls into confusionand contradictions, from which it conjectures the presence of latenterrors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because theprinciples it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot betested by that criterion. The arena of these endless contests is called_Metaphysic_.Time was, when she was the _queen_ of all the sciences; and, if we takethe will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards thehigh importance of her object-matter, this title of honour. Now, it isthe fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and thematron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:Modo maxima rerum,Tot generis, natisque potens...Nunc trahor exul, inops.—Ovid, Metamorphoses. xiiiAt first, her government, under the administration of the _dogmatists_,was an absolute _despotism_. But, as the legislative continued to showtraces of the ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, andintestine wars introduced the reign of _anarchy;_ while the _sceptics_,like nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and settled modeof living, attacked from time to time those who had organizedthemselves into civil communities. But their number was, very happily,small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions ofthose who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled oruniform plan. In recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing thosedisputes settled, and the legitimacy of her claims established by akind of _physiology_ of the human understanding—that of the celebratedLocke. But it was found that—although it was affirmed that thisso-called queen could not refer her descent to any higher source thanthat of common experience, a circumstance which necessarily broughtsuspicion on her claims—as this _genealogy_ was incorrect, shepersisted in the advancement of her claims to sovereignty. Thusmetaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rottenconstitution of _dogmatism_, and again became obnoxious to the contemptfrom which efforts had been made to save it. At present, as allmethods, according to the general persuasion, have been tried in vain,there reigns nought but weariness and complete _indifferentism_—themother of chaos and night in the scientific world, but at the same timethe source of, or at least the prelude to, the re-creation andreinstallation of a science, when it has fallen into confusion,obscurity, and disuse from ill directed effort.For it is in reality vain to profess _indifference_ in regard to suchinquiries, the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity.Besides, these pretended _indifferentists_, however much they may tryto disguise themselves by the assumption of a popular style and bychanges on the language of the schools, unavoidably fall intometaphysical declarations and propositions, which they profess toregard with so much contempt. At the same time, this indifference,which has arisen in the world of science, and which relates to thatkind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last, is aphenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection. It isplainly not the effect of the levity, but of the matured _judgement_[1]of the age, which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusoryknowledge, It is, in fact, a call to reason, again to undertake themost laborious of all tasks—that of self-examination, and to establisha tribunal, which may secure it in its well-grounded claims, while itpronounces against all baseless assumptions and pretensions, not in anarbitrary manner, but according to its own eternal and unchangeablelaws. This tribunal is nothing less than the _Critical Investigation ofPure Reason_. [1] We very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present age, and of the decay of profound science. But I do not think that those which rest upon a secure foundation, such as mathematics, physical science, etc., in the least deserve this reproach, but that they rather maintain their ancient fame, and in the latter case, indeed, far surpass it. The same would be the case with the other kinds of cognition, if their principles were but firmly established. In the absence of this security, indifference, doubt, and finally, severe criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought. Our age is the age of criticism, to which everything must be subjected. The sacredness of religion, and the authority of legislation, are by many regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this tribunal. But, if they are exempted, they become the subjects of just suspicion, and cannot lay claim to sincere respect, which reason accords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public examination.I do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems, but a criticalinquiry into the faculty of reason, with reference to the cognitions towhich it strives to attain _without the aid of experience;_ in otherwords, the solution of the question regarding the possibility orimpossibility of metaphysics, and the determination of the origin, aswell as of the extent and limits of this science. All this must be doneon the basis of principles.This path—the only one now remaining—has been entered upon by me; and Iflatter myself that I have, in this way, discovered the cause of—andconsequently the mode of removing—all the errors which have hithertoset reason at variance with itself, in the sphere of non-empiricalthought. I have not returned an evasive answer to the questions ofreason, by alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties ofthe mind; I have, on the contrary, examined them completely in thelight of principles, and, after having discovered the cause of thedoubts and contradictions into which reason fell, have solved them toits perfect satisfaction. It is true, these questions have not beensolved as dogmatism, in its vain fancies and desires, had expected; forit can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts, and of theseI have no knowledge. But neither do these come within the compass ofour mental powers; and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy theillusions which had their origin in misconceptions, whatever darlinghopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations. Mychief aim in this work has been thoroughness; and I make bold to saythat there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find itssolution, or at least the key to its solution, here. Pure reason is aperfect unity; and therefore, if the principle presented by it prove tobe insufficient for the solution of even a single one of thosequestions to which the very nature of reason gives birth, we mustreject it, as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency inthe case of the others.While I say this, I think I see upon the countenance of the readersigns of dissatisfaction mingled with contempt, when he hearsdeclarations which sound so boastful and extravagant; and yet they arebeyond comparison more moderate than those advanced by the commonestauthor of the commonest philosophical programme, in which the dogmatistprofesses to demonstrate the simple nature of the soul, or thenecessity of a primal being. Such a dogmatist promises to extend humanknowledge beyond the limits of possible experience; while I humblyconfess that this is completely beyond my power. Instead of any suchattempt, I confine myself to the examination of reason alone and itspure thought; and I do not need to seek far for the sum-total of itscognition, because it has its seat in my own mind. Besides, commonlogic presents me with a complete and systematic catalogue of all thesimple operations of reason; and it is my task to answer the questionhow far reason can go, without the material presented and the aidfurnished by experience.So much for the completeness and thoroughness necessary in theexecution of the present task. The aims set before us are notarbitrarily proposed, but are imposed upon us by the nature ofcognition itself.The above remarks relate to the _matter_ of our critical inquiry. Asregards the _form_, there are two indispensable conditions, which anyone who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of purereason, is bound to fulfil. These conditions are _certitude_ and_clearness_.As regards _certitude_, I have fully convinced myself that, in thissphere of thought, _opinion_ is perfectly inadmissible, and thateverything which bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must beexcluded, as of no value in such discussions. For it is a necessarycondition of every cognition that is to be established upon _à priori_grounds that it shall be held to be absolutely necessary; much more isthis the case with an attempt to determine all pure _à priori_cognition, and to furnish the standard—and consequently an example—ofall apodeictic (philosophical) certitude. Whether I have succeeded inwhat I professed to do, it is for the reader to determine; it is theauthor’s business merely to adduce grounds and reasons, withoutdetermining what influence these ought to have on the mind of hisjudges. But, lest anything he may have said may become the innocentcause of doubt in their minds, or tend to weaken the effect which hisarguments might otherwise produce—he may be allowed to point out thosepassages which may occasion mistrust or difficulty, although these donot concern the main purpose of the present work. He does this solelywith the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts whichmight affect his judgement of the work as a whole, and in regard to itsultimate aim.I know no investigations more necessary for a full insight into thenature of the faculty which we call _understanding_, and at the sametime for the determination of the rules and limits of its use, thanthose undertaken in the second chapter of the “TranscendentalAnalytic,” under the title of _Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of theUnderstanding;_ and they have also cost me by far the greatestlabour—labour which, I hope, will not remain uncompensated. The viewthere taken, which goes somewhat deeply into the subject, has twosides. The one relates to the objects of the pure understanding, and isintended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the objectivevalidity of its _à priori_ conceptions; and it forms for this reason anessential part of the Critique. The other considers the pureunderstanding itself, its possibility and its powers of cognition—thatis, from a subjective point of view; and, although this exposition isof great importance, it does not belong essentially to the main purposeof the work, because the grand question is what and how much can reasonand understanding, apart from experience, cognize, and not, how is the_faculty of thought_ itself possible? As the latter is an inquiry intothe cause of a given effect, and has thus in it some semblance of anhypothesis (although, as I shall show on another occasion, this isreally not the fact), it would seem that, in the present instance, Ihad allowed myself to enounce a mere _opinion_, and that the readermust therefore be at liberty to hold a different _opinion_. But I begto remind him that, if my subjective deduction does not produce in hismind the conviction of its certitude at which I aimed, the objectivededuction, with which alone the present work is properly concerned, isin every respect satisfactory.As regards _clearness_, the reader has a right to demand, in the firstplace, _discursive_ or logical clearness, that is, on the basis ofconceptions, and, secondly, _intuitive_ or æsthetic clearness, by meansof intuitions, that is, by examples or other modes of illustration _inconcreto_. I have done what I could for the first kind ofintelligibility. This was essential to my purpose; and it thus becamethe accidental cause of my inability to do complete justice to thesecond requirement. I have been almost always at a loss, during theprogress of this work, how to settle this question. Examples andillustrations always appeared to me necessary, and, in the first sketchof the Critique, naturally fell into their proper places. But I verysoon became aware of the magnitude of my task, and the numerousproblems with which I should be engaged; and, as I perceived that thiscritical investigation would, even if delivered in the driest_scholastic_ manner, be far from being brief, I found it unadvisable toenlarge it still more with examples and explanations, which arenecessary only from a _popular_ point of view. I was induced to takethis course from the consideration also that the present work is notintended for popular use, that those devoted to science do not requiresuch helps, although they are always acceptable, and that they wouldhave materially interfered with my present purpose. Abbé Terrassonremarks with great justice that, if we estimate the size of a work, notfrom the number of its pages, but from the time which we require tomake ourselves master of it, it may be said of many a book—_that itwould be much shorter, if it were not so short_. On the other hand, asregards the comprehensibility of a system of speculative cognition,connected under a single principle, we may say with equal justice: manya book would have been much clearer, if it had not been intended to beso very clear. For explanations and examples, and other helps tointelligibility, aid us in the comprehension of _parts_, but theydistract the attention, dissipate the mental power of the reader, andstand in the way of his forming a clear conception of the _whole;_ ashe cannot attain soon enough to a survey of the system, and thecolouring and embellishments bestowed upon it prevent his observing itsarticulation or organization—which is the most important considerationwith him, when he comes to judge of its unity and stability.The reader must naturally have a strong inducement to co-operate withthe present author, if he has formed the intention of erecting acomplete and solid edifice of metaphysical science, according to theplan now laid before him. Metaphysics, as here represented, is the onlyscience which admits of completion—and with little labour, if it isunited, in a short time; so that nothing will be left to futuregenerations except the task of illustrating and applying it_didactically_. For this science is nothing more than the inventory ofall that is given us by _pure reason_, systematically arranged. Nothingcan escape our notice; for what reason produces from itself cannot lieconcealed, but must be brought to the light by reason itself, so soonas we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek. Theperfect unity of this kind of cognitions, which are based upon pureconceptions, and uninfluenced by any empirical element, or any peculiarintuition leading to determinate experience, renders this completenessnot only practicable, but also necessary.Tecum habita, et nôris quam sit tibi curta supellex.—Persius. Satirae iv. 52.Such a system of pure speculative reason I hope to be able to publishunder the title of _Metaphysic of Nature_[2]. The content of this work(which will not be half so long) will be very much richer than that ofthe present Critique, which has to discover the sources of thiscognition and expose the conditions of its possibility, and at the sametime to clear and level a fit foundation for the scientific edifice. Inthe present work, I look for the patient hearing and the impartialityof a _judge;_ in the other, for the good-will and assistance of a_co-labourer_. For, however complete the list of _principles_ for thissystem may be in the Critique, the correctness of the system requiresthat no _deduced_ conceptions should be absent. These cannot bepresented _à priori_, but must be gradually discovered; and, while the_synthesis_ of conceptions has been fully exhausted in the Critique, itis necessary that, in the proposed work, the same should be the casewith their _analysis_. But this will be rather an amusement than alabour. [2] In contradistinction to the Metaphysic of Ethics. This work was never published.PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 1787Whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lieswithin the province of pure reason advances with that undeviatingcertainty which characterizes the progress of _science_, we shall be atno loss to determine. If we find those who are engaged in metaphysicalpursuits, unable to come to an understanding as to the method whichthey ought to follow; if we find them, after the most elaboratepreparations, invariably brought to a stand before the goal is reached,and compelled to retrace their steps and strike into fresh paths, wemay then feel quite sure that they are far from having attained to thecertainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be merelygroping about in the dark. In these circumstances we shall render animportant service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the pathalong which it must travel, in order to arrive at any results—even ifit should be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which,without reflection, have been proposed for its attainment.That _Logic_ has advanced in this sure course, even from the earliesttimes, is apparent from the fact that, since Aristotle, it has beenunable to advance a step and, thus, to all appearance has reached itscompletion. For, if some of the moderns have thought to enlarge itsdomain by introducing _psychological_ discussions on the mentalfaculties, such as imagination and wit, _metaphysical_, discussions onthe origin of knowledge and the different kinds of certitude, accordingto the difference of the objects (idealism, scepticism, and so on), or_anthropological_ discussions on prejudices, their causes and remedies:this attempt, on the part of these authors, only shows their ignoranceof the peculiar nature of logical science. We do not enlarge butdisfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limitsand allow them to run into one another. Now logic is enclosed withinlimits which admit of perfectly clear definition; it is a science whichhas for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the _formal_laws of all thought, whether it be _à priori_ or empirical, whatever beits origin or its object, and whatever the difficulties—natural oraccidental—which it encounters in the human mind.The early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to thenarrowness of its field, in which abstraction may, or rather must, bemade of all the objects of cognition with their characteristicdistinctions, and in which the understanding has only to deal withitself and with its own forms. It is, obviously, a much more difficulttask for reason to strike into the sure path of science, where it hasto deal not simply with itself, but with objects external to itself.Hence, logic is properly only a _propædeutic_—forms, as it were, thevestibule of the sciences; and while it is necessary to enable us toform a correct judgement with regard to the various branches ofknowledge, still the acquisition of real, substantive knowledge is tobe sought only in the sciences properly so called, that is, in theobjective sciences.Now these sciences, if they can be termed rational at all, must containelements of _à priori_ cognition, and this cognition may stand in atwofold relation to its object. Either it may have to _determine_ theconception of the object—which must be supplied extraneously, or it mayhave to _establish its reality_. The former is _theoretical_, thelatter _practical_, rational cognition. In both, the _pure_ or _àpriori_ element must be treated first, and must be carefullydistinguished from that which is supplied from other sources. Any othermethod can only lead to irremediable confusion._Mathematics_ and _physics_ are the two theoretical sciences which haveto determine their objects _à priori_. The former is purely _à priori_,the latter is partially so, but is also dependent on other sources ofcognition.In the earliest times of which history affords us any record,_mathematics_ had already entered on the sure course of science, amongthat wonderful nation, the Greeks. Still it is not to be supposed thatit was as easy for this science to strike into, or rather to constructfor itself, that royal road, as it was for logic, in which reason hasonly to deal with itself. On the contrary, I believe that it must haveremained long—chiefly among the Egyptians—in the stage of blind gropingafter its true aims and destination, and that it was revolutionized bythe happy idea of one man, who struck out and determined for all timethe path which this science must follow, and which admits of anindefinite advancement. The history of this intellectualrevolution—much more important in its results than the discovery of thepassage round the celebrated Cape of Good Hope—and of its author, hasnot been preserved. But Diogenes Laertius, in naming the supposeddiscoverer of some of the simplest elements of geometricaldemonstration—elements which, according to the ordinary opinion, do noteven require to be proved—makes it apparent that the change introducedby the first indication of this new path, must have seemed of theutmost importance to the mathematicians of that age, and it has thusbeen secured against the chance of oblivion. A new light must haveflashed on the mind of the first man (_Thales_, or whatever may havebeen his name) who demonstrated the properties of the _isosceles_triangle. For he found that it was not sufficient to meditate on thefigure, as it lay before his eyes, or the conception of it, as itexisted in his mind, and thus endeavour to get at the knowledge of itsproperties, but that it was necessary to produce these properties, asit were, by a positive _à priori construction;_ and that, in order toarrive with certainty at _à priori_ cognition, he must not attribute tothe object any other properties than those which necessarily followedfrom that which he had himself, in accordance with his conception,placed in the object.A much longer period elapsed before _Physics_ entered on the highway ofscience. For it is only about a century and a half since the wise BACONgave a new direction to physical studies, or rather—as others werealready on the right track—imparted fresh vigour to the pursuit of thisnew direction. Here, too, as in the case of mathematics, we findevidence of a rapid intellectual revolution. In the remarks whichfollow I shall confine myself to the _empirical_ side of naturalscience.When GALILEI experimented with balls of a definite weight on theinclined plane, when TORRICELLI caused the air to sustain a weightwhich he had calculated beforehand to be equal to that of a definitecolumn of water, or when STAHL, at a later period, converted metalsinto lime, and reconverted lime into metal, by the addition andsubtraction of certain elements;[3] a light broke upon all naturalphilosophers. They learned that reason only perceives that which itproduces after its own design; that it must not be content to follow,as it were, in the leading-strings of nature, but must proceed inadvance with principles of judgement according to unvarying laws, andcompel nature to reply its questions. For accidental observations, madeaccording to no preconceived plan, cannot be united under a necessarylaw. But it is this that reason seeks for and requires. It is only theprinciples of reason which can give to concordant phenomena thevalidity of laws, and it is only when experiment is directed by theserational principles that it can have any real utility. Reason mustapproach nature with the view, indeed, of receiving information fromit, not, however, in the character of a pupil, who listens to all thathis master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels thewitnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit topropose. To this single idea must the revolution be ascribed, by which,after groping in the dark for so many centuries, natural science was atlength conducted into the path of certain progress. [3] I do not here follow with exactness the history of the experimental method, of which, indeed, the first steps are involved in some obscurity.We come now to _metaphysics_, a purely speculative science, whichoccupies a completely isolated position and is entirely independent ofthe teachings of experience. It deals with mere conceptions—not, likemathematics, with conceptions applied to intuition—and in it, reason isthe pupil of itself alone. It is the oldest of the sciences, and wouldstill survive, even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss ofan all-destroying barbarism. But it has not yet had the good fortune toattain to the sure scientific method. This will be apparent; if weapply the tests which we proposed at the outset. We find that reasonperpetually comes to a stand, when it attempts to gain _à priori_ theperception even of those laws which the most common experienceconfirms. We find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerableinstances, and to abandon the path on which it had entered, becausethis does not lead to the desired result. We find, too, that those whoare engaged in metaphysical pursuits are far from being able to agreeamong themselves, but that, on the contrary, this science appears tofurnish an arena specially adapted for the display of skill or theexercise of strength in mock-contests—a field in which no combatantever yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground, in which, at least, novictory was ever yet crowned with permanent possession.This leads us to inquire why it is that, in metaphysics, the sure pathof science has not hitherto been found. Shall we suppose that it isimpossible to discover it? Why then should nature have visited ourreason with restless aspirations after it, as if it were one of ourweightiest concerns? Nay, more, how little cause should we have toplace confidence in our reason, if it abandons us in a matter aboutwhich, most of all, we desire to know the truth—and not only so, buteven allures us to the pursuit of vain phantoms, only to betray us inthe end? Or, if the path has only hitherto been missed, whatindications do we possess to guide us in a renewed investigation, andto enable us to hope for greater success than has fallen to the lot ofour predecessors?It appears to me that the examples of mathematics and naturalphilosophy, which, as we have seen, were brought into their presentcondition by a sudden revolution, are sufficiently remarkable to fixour attention on the essential circumstances of the change which hasproved so advantageous to them, and to induce us to make the experimentof imitating them, so far as the analogy which, as rational sciences,they bear to metaphysics may permit. It has hitherto been assumed thatour cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts toascertain anything about these objects _à priori_, by means ofconceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have beenrendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experimentwhether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume thatthe objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events,to accord better with the _possibility_ of our gaining the end we havein view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects _àpriori_, of determining something with respect to these objects, beforethey are given to us. We here propose to do just what COPERNICUS did inattempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that hecould make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodiesrevolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried theexperiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the starsremained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to theintuition of objects. If the intuition must conform to the nature ofthe objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them _à priori_.If, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our facultyof intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an _àpriori_ knowledge. Now as I cannot rest in the mere intuitions, but—ifthey are to become cognitions—must refer them, as _representations_, tosomething, as _object_, and must determine the latter by means of theformer, here again there are two courses open to me. _Either_, first, Imay assume that the conceptions, by which I effect this determination,conform to the object—and in this case I am reduced to the sameperplexity as before; _or_ secondly, I may assume that the objects, or,which is the same thing, that _experience_, in which alone as givenobjects they are cognized, conform to my conceptions—and then I am atno loss how to proceed. For experience itself is a mode of cognitionwhich requires understanding. Before objects, are given to me, that is,_à priori_, I must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding whichare expressed in conceptions _à priori_. To these conceptions, then,all the objects of experience must necessarily conform. Now there areobjects which reason _thinks_, and that necessarily, but which cannotbe given in experience, or, at least, cannot be given _so_ as reasonthinks them. The attempt to think these objects will hereafter furnishan excellent test of the new method of thought which we have adopted,and which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things _àpriori_ that which we ourselves place in them.[4] [4] This method, accordingly, which we have borrowed from the natural philosopher, consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in that _which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment_. Now the propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the limits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any experiment with their _objects_, as in natural science. Hence, with regard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume _à priori_, our only course will be to view them from two different sides. We must regard one and the same conception, _on the one hand_, in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the understanding, _on the other hand_, in relation to reason, isolated and transcending the limits of experience, as an object of mere thought. Now if we find that, when we regard things from this double point of view, the result is in harmony with the principle of pure reason, but that, when we regard them from a single point of view, reason is involved in self-contradiction, then the experiment will establish the correctness of this distinction.This attempt succeeds as well as we could desire, and promises tometaphysics, in its first part—that is, where it is occupied withconceptions _à priori_, of which the corresponding objects may be givenin experience—the certain course of science. For by this new method weare enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of _à priori_cognition, and, what is more, to demonstrate satisfactorily the lawswhich lie _à priori_ at the foundation of nature, as the sum of theobjects of experience—neither of which was possible according to theprocedure hitherto followed. But from this deduction of the faculty of_à priori_ cognition in the first part of metaphysics, we derive asurprising result, and one which, to all appearance, militates againstthe great end of metaphysics, as treated in the second part. For wecome to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable totranscend the limits of possible experience; and yet this is preciselythe most essential object of this science. The estimate of our rationalcognition _à priori_ at which we arrive is that it has only to do withphenomena, and that things in themselves, while possessing a realexistence, lie beyond its sphere. Here we are enabled to put thejustice of this estimate to the test. For that which of necessityimpels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena isthe _unconditioned_, which reason absolutely requires in things as theyare in themselves, in order to complete the series of conditions. Now,if it appears that when, on the one hand, we assume that our cognitionconforms to its objects as things in themselves, _the unconditionedcannot be thought without contradiction_, and that when, on the otherhand, we assume that our representation of things as they are given tous, does not conform to these things as they are in themselves, butthat these objects, as phenomena, conform to our mode ofrepresentation, _the contradiction disappears:_ we shall then beconvinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sakeof experiment; we may look upon it as established that theunconditioned does not lie in things as we know them, or as they aregiven to us, but in things as they are in themselves, beyond the rangeof our cognition.[5] [5] This experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of the _Chemists_, which they term the experiment of _reduction_, or, more usually, the _synthetic_ process. The _analysis_ of the metaphysician separates pure cognition _à priori_ into two heterogeneous elements, viz., the cognition of things as phenomena, and of things in themselves. _Dialectic_ combines these again into harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, and finds that this harmony never results except through the above distinction, which is, therefore, concluded to be just.But, after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to makeany progress in the sphere of the supersensible, it still remains forour consideration whether data do not exist in _practical_ cognitionwhich may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of theunconditioned, to rise beyond the limits of all possible experiencefrom a _practical_ point of view, and thus to satisfy the great ends ofmetaphysics. Speculative reason has thus, at least, made room for suchan extension of our knowledge: and, if it must leave this space vacant,still it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up, if we can, bymeans of practical data—nay, it even challenges us to make theattempt.[6] [6] So the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies established the truth of that which Copernicus, first, assumed only as a hypothesis, and, at the same time, brought to light that invisible force (Newtonian attraction) which holds the universe together. The latter would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not ventured on the experiment—contrary to the senses but still just—of looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies, but in the spectator. In this Preface I treat the new metaphysical method as a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at such a change of method, which are always hypothetical. But in the Critique itself it will be demonstrated, not hypothetically, but apodeictically, from the nature of our representations of space and time, and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding.This attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure ofmetaphysics, after the _example_ of the geometricians and naturalphilosophers, constitutes the aim of the Critique of Pure SpeculativeReason. It is a treatise on the method to be followed, not a system ofthe science itself. But, at the same time, it marks out and definesboth the external boundaries and the internal structure of thisscience. For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity, that, inchoosing the various objects of thought, it is able to define thelimits of its own faculties, and even to give a complete enumeration ofthe possible modes of proposing problems to itself, and thus to sketchout the entire system of metaphysics. For, on the one hand, incognition _à priori_, nothing must be attributed to the objects butwhat the thinking subject derives from itself; and, on the other hand,reason is, in regard to the principles of cognition, a perfectlydistinct, independent unity, in which, as in an organized body, everymember exists for the sake of the others, and all for the sake of each,so that no principle can be viewed, with safety, in one relationship,unless it is, at the same time, viewed in relation to the total use ofpure reason. Hence, too, metaphysics has this singular advantage—anadvantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to dowith _objects_—that, if once it is conducted into the sure path ofscience, by means of this criticism, it can then take in the wholesphere of its cognitions, and can thus complete its work, and leave itfor the use of posterity, as a capital which can never receive freshaccessions. For metaphysics has to deal only with principles and withthe limitations of its own employment as determined by theseprinciples. To this perfection it is, therefore, bound, as thefundamental science, to attain, and to it the maxim may justly beapplied: Nil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum.But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we proposeto bequeath to posterity? What is the real value of this system ofmetaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanentcondition? A cursory view of the present work will lead to thesupposition that its use is merely _negative_, that it only serves towarn us against venturing, with speculative reason, beyond the limitsof experience. This is, in fact, its primary use. But this, at once,assumes a _positive_ value, when we observe that the principles withwhich speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits leadinevitably, not to the _extension_, but to the _contraction_ of the useof reason, inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits ofsensibility, which is their proper sphere, over the entire realm ofthought and, thus, to supplant the pure (practical) use of reason. Sofar, then, as this criticism is occupied in confining speculativereason within its proper bounds, it is only negative; but, inasmuch asit thereby, at the same time, removes an obstacle which impedes andeven threatens to destroy the use of practical reason, it possesses apositive and very important value. In order to admit this, we have onlyto be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of purereason—the moral use—in which it inevitably transcends the limits ofsensibility, without the aid of speculation, requiring only to beinsured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it incontradiction with itself. To deny the positive advantage of theservice which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as tomaintain that the system of police is productive of no positivebenefit, since its main business is to prevent the violence whichcitizen has to apprehend from citizen, that so each may pursue hisvocation in peace and security. That space and time are only forms ofsensible intuition, and hence are only conditions of the existence ofthings as phenomena; that, moreover, we have no conceptions of theunderstanding, and, consequently, no elements for the cognition ofthings, except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given tothese conceptions; that, accordingly, we can have no cognition of anobject, as a thing in itself, but only as an object of sensibleintuition, that is, as phenomenon—all this is proved in the analyticalpart of the Critique; and from this the limitation of all possiblespeculative cognition to the mere objects of _experience_, follows as anecessary result. At the same time, it must be carefully borne in mindthat, while we surrender the power of _cognizing_, we still reserve thepower of _thinking_ objects, as things in themselves.[7] For,otherwise, we should require to affirm the existence of an appearance,without something that appears—which would be absurd. Now let ussuppose, for a moment, that we had not undertaken this criticism and,accordingly, had not drawn the necessary distinction between things asobjects of experience and things as they are in themselves. Theprinciple of causality, and, by consequence, the mechanism of nature asdetermined by causality, would then have absolute validity in relationto all things as efficient causes. I should then be unable to assert,with regard to one and the same being, e.g., the human soul, that itswill is _free_, and yet, at the same time, subject to naturalnecessity, that is, _not free_, without falling into a palpablecontradiction, for in both propositions I should take the soul in _thesame signification_, as a thing in general, as a thing in itself—as,without previous criticism, I could not but take it. Suppose now, onthe other hand, that we _have_ undertaken this criticism, and havelearnt that an object may be taken in _two senses_, first, as aphenomenon, secondly, as a thing in itself; and that, according to thededuction of the conceptions of the understanding, the principle ofcausality has reference only to things in the first sense. We then seehow it does not involve any contradiction to assert, on the one hand,that the will, in the phenomenal sphere—in visible action—isnecessarily obedient to the law of nature, and, in so far, _not free;_and, on the other hand, that, as belonging to a thing in itself, it isnot subject to that law, and, accordingly, is _free_. Now, it is truethat I cannot, by means of speculative reason, and still less byempirical observation, _cognize_ my soul as a thing in itself andconsequently, cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being towhich I ascribe effects in the world of sense. For, to do so, I mustcognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, which—since Icannot support my conception by any intuition—is impossible. At thesame time, while I cannot _cognize_, I can quite well _think_ freedom,that is to say, my representation of it involves at least nocontradiction, if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the twomodes of representation (the sensible and the intellectual) and theconsequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding andof the principles which flow from them. Suppose now that moralitynecessarily presupposed liberty, in the strictest sense, as a propertyof our will; suppose that reason contained certain practical, originalprinciples _à priori_, which were absolutely impossible without thispresupposition; and suppose, at the same time, that speculative reasonhad proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all. It wouldthen follow that the moral presupposition must give way to thespeculative affirmation, the opposite of which involves an obviouscontradiction, and that _liberty_ and, with it, morality must yield tothe _mechanism of nature;_ for the negation of morality involves nocontradiction, except on the presupposition of liberty. Now moralitydoes not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enoughthat I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction,that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature. But even thisrequirement we could not satisfy, if we had not learnt the twofoldsense in which things may be taken; and it is only in this way that thedoctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are confined withintheir proper limits. For this result, then, we are indebted to acriticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard tothings in themselves, and establishes the necessary limitation of ourtheoretical _cognition_ to mere phenomena. [7] In order to _cognize_ an object, I must be able to prove its possibility, either from its reality as attested by experience, or _à priori_, by means of reason. But I can _think_ what I please, provided only I do not contradict myself; that is, provided my conception is a possible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities. But something more is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective validity, that is real possibility—the other possibility being merely logical. We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but may derive them from practical sources.The positive value of the critical principles of pure reason inrelation to the conception of _God_ and of the _simple nature_ of the_soul_, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shallnot dwell. I cannot even make the assumption—as the practical interestsof morality require—of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do notdeprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight.For to arrive at these, it must make use of principles which, in fact,extend only to the objects of possible experience, and which cannot beapplied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them intophenomena, and thus rendering the _practical extension_ of pure reasonimpossible. I must, therefore, abolish _knowledge_, to make room for_belief_. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption thatit is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, isthe true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militatesagainst morality.Thus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy toposterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed inaccordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such abequest is not to be depreciated. It will render an important serviceto reason, by substituting the certainty of scientific method for thatrandom groping after results without the guidance of principles, whichhas hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies. It willrender an important service to the inquiring mind of youth, by leadingthe student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science,instead of wasting them, as at present, on speculations which can neverlead to any result, or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas andopinions. But, above all, it will confer an inestimable benefit onmorality and religion, by showing that all the objections urged againstthem may be silenced for ever by the _Socratic_ method, that is to say,by proving the ignorance of the objector. For, as the world has neverbeen, and, no doubt, never will be without a system of metaphysics ofone kind or another, it is the highest and weightiest concern ofphilosophy to render it powerless for harm, by closing up the sourcesof error.This important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of itsfancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does notprove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity. Theadvantages which the world has derived from the teachings of purereason are not at all impaired. The loss falls, in its whole extent, onthe _monopoly of the schools_, but does not in the slightest degreetouch the _interests of mankind_. I appeal to the most obstinatedogmatist, whether the proof of the continued existence of the soulafter death, derived from the simplicity of its substance; of thefreedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature,drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective andobjective practical necessity; or of the existence of God, deduced fromthe conception of an _ens realissimum_—the contingency of thechangeable, and the necessity of a prime mover, has ever been able topass beyond the limits of the schools, to penetrate the public mind, orto exercise the slightest influence on its convictions. It must beadmitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to theunfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, itcan never be expected to take place. On the contrary, it is plain that_the hope of a future life_ arises from the feeling, which exists inthe breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet andsatisfy the demands of his nature. In like manner, it cannot be doubtedthat the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims ofinclination, gives rise to the consciousness of _freedom_, and that theglorious order, beauty, and providential care, everywhere displayed innature, give rise to the belief in a wise and great Author of theUniverse. Such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind,so far as they depend on rational grounds; and this public property notonly remains undisturbed, but is even raised to greater importance, bythe doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves amore profound insight into a matter of general human concernment thanthat to which the great mass of men, ever held by us in the highestestimation, can without difficulty attain, and that the schools should,therefore, confine themselves to the elaboration of these universallycomprehensible and, from a moral point of view, amply satisfactoryproofs. The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions ofthe schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusivepossession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public. Quod mecum nescit, solus vult scire videri.At the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of hisjust title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits thepublic without its knowledge—I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason. Thiscan never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; forfinespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as littleimpression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections broughtagainst these truths. On the other hand, since both inevitably forcethemselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation, itbecomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thoroughinvestigation of the rights of speculative reason and, thus, to preventthe scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later,to cause even to the masses. It is only by criticism thatmetaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from thesecontroversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines.Criticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism, fatalism,atheism, free-thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which areuniversally injurious—as well as of idealism and scepticism, which aredangerous to the schools, but can scarcely pass over to the public. Ifgovernments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned,it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests ofscience, as well as for those of society, to favour a criticism of thiskind, by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firmbasis, than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools, whichraise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction ofcobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and the lossof which, therefore, it can never feel.This critical science is not opposed to the _dogmatic procedure_ ofreason in pure cognition; for pure cognition must always be dogmatic,that is, must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles _àpriori_—but to _dogmatism_, that is, to the presumption that it ispossible to make any progress with a pure cognition, derived from(philosophical) conceptions, according to the principles which reasonhas long been in the habit of employing—without first inquiring in whatway and by what right reason has come into the possession of theseprinciples. Dogmatism is thus the dogmatic procedure of pure reason_without previous criticism of its own powers_, and in opposing thisprocedure, we must not be supposed to lend any countenance to thatloquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name ofpopularity, nor yet to scepticism, which makes short work with thewhole science of metaphysics. On the contrary, our criticism is thenecessary preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysicswhich must perform its task entirely _à priori_, to the completesatisfaction of speculative reason, and must, therefore, be treated,not popularly, but scholastically. In carrying out the plan which theCritique prescribes, that is, in the future system of metaphysics, wemust have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated WOLF, thegreatest of all dogmatic philosophers. He was the first to point outthe necessity of establishing fixed principles, of clearly defining ourconceptions, and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severescrutiny, instead of rashly jumping at conclusions. The example whichhe set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thoroughinvestigation which is not yet extinct in Germany. He would have beenpeculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character tometaphysical studies, had it occurred to him to prepare the field by acriticism of the _organum_, that is, of pure reason itself. That hefailed to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribedto the dogmatic mode of thought which characterized his age, and onthis point the philosophers of his time, as well as of all previoustimes, have nothing to reproach each other with. Those who reject atonce the method of Wolf, and of the Critique of Pure Reason, can haveno other aim but to shake off the fetters of _science_, to changelabour into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy intophilodoxy.In this _second edition_, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, toremove the difficulties and obscurity which, without fault of mineperhaps, have given rise to many misconceptions even among acutethinkers. In the propositions themselves, and in the demonstrations bywhich they are supported, as well as in the form and the entire plan ofthe work, I have found nothing to alter; which must be attributedpartly to the long examination to which I had subjected the wholebefore offering it to the public and partly to the nature of the case.For pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there isnothing isolated or independent, but every Single part is essential toall the rest; and hence, the slightest imperfection, whether defect orpositive error, could not fail to betray itself in use. I venture,further, to hope, that this system will maintain the same unalterablecharacter for the future. I am led to entertain this confidence, not byvanity, but by the evidence which the equality of the result affords,when we proceed, first, from the simplest elements up to the completewhole of pure reason and, and then, backwards from the whole to eachpart. We find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration, in anypart, leads inevitably to contradictions, not merely in this system,but in human reason itself. At the same time, there is still much roomfor improvement in the _exposition_ of the doctrines contained in thiswork. In the present edition, I have endeavoured to removemisapprehensions of the æsthetical part, especially with regard to theconception of time; to clear away the obscurity which has been found inthe deduction of the conceptions of the understanding; to supply thesupposed want of sufficient evidence in the demonstration of theprinciples of the pure understanding; and, lastly, to obviate themisunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede theRational Psychology. Beyond this point—the end of the second maindivision of the “Transcendental Dialectic”—I have not extended myalterations,[8] partly from want of time, and partly because I am notaware that any portion of the remainder has given rise tomisconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics, whom I do nothere mention with that praise which is their due, but who will findthat their suggestions have been attended to in the work itself. [8] The only addition, properly so called—and that only in the method of proof—which I have made in the present edition, consists of a new refutation of psychological _Idealism_, and a strict demonstration—the only one possible, as I believe—of the objective reality of external intuition. However harmless idealism may be considered—although in reality it is not so—in regard to the essential ends of metaphysics, it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human reason to be obliged to assume, as an article of mere belief, the existence of things external to ourselves (from which, yet, we derive the whole material of cognition for the internal sense), and not to be able to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in question. As there is some obscurity of expression in the demonstration as it stands in the text, I propose to alter the passage in question as follows: “But this permanent cannot be an intuition in me. For all the determining grounds of my existence which can be found in me are representations and, as such, do themselves require a permanent, distinct from them, which may determine my existence in relation to their changes, that is, my existence in time, wherein they change.” It may, probably, be urged in opposition to this proof that, after all, I am only conscious immediately of that which is in me, that is, of my _representation_ of external things, and that, consequently, it must always remain uncertain whether anything corresponding to this representation does or does not exist externally to me. But I am conscious, through internal _experience_, of my _existence in time_ (consequently, also, of the determinability of the former in the latter), and that is more than the simple consciousness of my representation. It is, in fact, the same as the _empirical consciousness of my existence_, which can only be determined in relation to something, which, while connected with my existence, is _external to me_. This consciousness of my existence in time is, therefore, identical with the consciousness of a relation to something external to me, and it is, therefore, experience, not fiction, sense, not imagination, which inseparably connects the external with my internal sense. For the external sense is, in itself, the relation of intuition to something real, external to me; and the reality of this something, as opposed to the mere imagination of it, rests solely on its inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition of its possibility. If with the _intellectual consciousness_ of my existence, in the representation: _I am_, which accompanies all my judgements, and all the operations of my understanding, I could, at the same time, connect a determination of my existence by _intellectual intuition_, then the consciousness of a relation to something external to me would not be necessary. But the internal intuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible and attached to the condition of time. Hence this determination of my existence, and consequently my internal experience itself, must depend on something permanent which is not in me, which can be, therefore, only in something external to me, to which I must look upon myself as being related. Thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily connected with that of the internal, in order to the possibility of experience in general; that is, I am just as certainly conscious that there are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I myself exist as determined in time. But in order to ascertain to what given intuitions objects, external me, really correspond, in other words, what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to imagination, I must have recourse, in every particular case, to those rules according to which experience in general (even internal experience) is distinguished from imagination, and which are always based on the proposition that there really is an external experience.—We may add the remark that the representation of something _permanent_ in existence, is not the same thing as the _permanent representation;_ for a representation may be very variable and changing—as all our representations, even that of matter, are—and yet refer to something permanent, which must, therefore, be distinct from all my representations and external to me, the existence of which is necessarily included in the determination of my own existence, and with it constitutes _one_ experience—an experience which would not even be possible internally, if it were not also at the same time, in part, external. To the question _How?_ we are no more able to reply, than we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the coexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of change.In attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible aspossible, I have been compelled to leave out or abridge variouspassages which were not essential to the completeness of the work, butwhich many readers might consider useful in other respects, and mightbe unwilling to miss. This trifling loss, which could not be avoidedwithout swelling the book beyond due limits, may be supplied, at thepleasure of the reader, by a comparison with the first edition, andwill, I hope, be more than compensated for by the greater clearness ofthe exposition as it now stands.I have observed, with pleasure and thankfulness, in the pages ofvarious reviews and treatises, that the spirit of profound and thoroughinvestigation is not extinct in Germany, though it may have beenoverborne and silenced for a time by the fashionable tone of a licencein thinking, which gives itself the airs of genius, and that thedifficulties which beset the paths of criticism have not preventedenergetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters of thescience of pure reason to which these paths conduct—a science which isnot popular, but scholastic in its character, and which alone can hopefor a lasting existence or possess an abiding value. To these deservingmen, who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucidexposition—a talent which I myself am not conscious of possessing—Ileave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to thestatement of my doctrines. For, in this case, the danger is not that ofbeing refuted, but of being misunderstood. For my own part, I musthenceforward abstain from controversy, although I shall carefullyattend to all suggestions, whether from friends or adversaries, whichmay be of use in the future elaboration of the system of thisPropædeutic. As, during these labours, I have advanced pretty far inyears this month I reach my sixty-fourth year—it will be necessary forme to economize time, if I am to carry out my plan of elaborating themetaphysics of nature as well as of morals, in confirmation of thecorrectness of the principles established in this Critique of PureReason, both speculative and practical; and I must, therefore, leavethe task of clearing up the obscurities of the present work—inevitable,perhaps, at the outset—as well as, the defence of the whole, to thosedeserving men, who have made my system their own. A philosophicalsystem cannot come forward armed at all points like a mathematicaltreatise, and hence it may be quite possible to take objection toparticular passages, while the organic structure of the system,considered as a unity, has no danger to apprehend. But few possess theability, and still fewer the inclination, to take a comprehensive viewof a new system. By confining the view to particular passages, takingthese out of their connection and comparing them with one another, itis easy to pick out apparent contradictions, especially in a workwritten with any freedom of style. These contradictions place the workin an unfavourable light in the eyes of those who rely on the judgementof others, but are easily reconciled by those who have mastered theidea of the whole. If a theory possesses stability in itself, theaction and reaction which seemed at first to threaten its existenceserve only, in the course of time, to smooth down any superficialroughness or inequality, and—if men of insight, impartiality, and trulypopular gifts, turn their attention to it—to secure to it, in a shorttime, the requisite elegance also.KÖNIGSBERG, _April_ 1787.IntroductionI. Of the difference between Pure and Empirical KnowledgeThat all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakenedinto exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect oursenses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouseour powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or toseparate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuousimpressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience? Inrespect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent toexperience, but begins with it.But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no meansfollows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it isquite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that whichwe receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognitionsupplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion),an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element givenby sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful inseparating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires closeinvestigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether thereexists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even ofall sensuous impressions? Knowledge of this kind is called à priori, incontradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources àposteriori, that is, in experience.But the expression, “à priori,” is not as yet definite enoughadequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, weare wont to say, that this or that may be known à priori, because we donot derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from ageneral rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, “he might know à priorithat it would have fallen;” that is, he needed not to have waited forthe experience that it did actually fall. But still, à priori, he couldnot know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently,that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been knownto him previously, by means of experience.By the term “knowledge à priori,” therefore, we shall in the sequelunderstand, not such as is independent of this or that kind ofexperience, but such as is absolutely so of all experience. Opposed tothis is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only àposteriori, that is, through experience. Knowledge à priori is eitherpure or impure. Pure knowledge à priori is that with which no empiricalelement is mixed up. For example, the proposition, “Every change has acause,” is a proposition à priori, but impure, because change is aconception which can only be derived from experience.II. The Human Intellect, even in an Unphilosophical State, is inPossession of Certain Cognitions “à priori”.The question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securelydistinguish a pure from an empirical cognition. Experience no doubtteaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such amanner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise. Now, in thefirst place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea ofnecessity in its very conception, it is priori. If, moreover, it is notderived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involvingthe idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori. Secondly, an empiricaljudgement never exhibits strict and absolute, but only assumed andcomparative universality (by induction); therefore, the most we can sayis—so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to thisor that rule. If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strictand absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, itis not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely à priori.Empirical universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension ofvalidity, from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid inmost cases, to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds goodin all; as, for example, in the affirmation, “All bodies are heavy.”When, on the contrary, strict universality characterizes a judgement,it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely,a faculty of cognition à priori. Necessity and strict universality,therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empiricalknowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other. But as in theuse of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easilydetected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimiteduniversality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincingproof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteriaseparately, each being by itself infallible.Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which arenecessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure àpriori, it will be an easy matter to show. If we desire an example fromthe sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If wecast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, theproposition, “Every change must have a cause,” will amply serve ourpurpose. In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause soplainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with aneffect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notionof a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume,from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes;and the habit thence originating of connecting representations—thenecessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective.Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing àpriori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are theindispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, andconsequently prove their existence à priori. For whence could ourexperience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which itdepends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one,therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as firstprinciples. But, for the present, we may content ourselves with havingestablished the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pureà priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the propertests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity.Not only in judgements, however, but even in conceptions, is an àpriori origin manifest. For example, if we take away by degrees fromour conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuousexperience—colour, hardness or softness, weight, evenimpenetrability—the body will then vanish; but the space which itoccupied still remains, and this it is utterly impossible to annihilatein thought. Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empiricalconception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all propertieswhich mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannotthink away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adheringto substance, although our conception of substance is more determinedthan that of an object. Compelled, therefore, by that necessity withwhich the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we mustconfess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition à priori.III. Philosophy stands in need of a Science which shall Determine thePossibility, Principles, and Extent of Human Knowledge “à priori”Of far more importance than all that has been above said, is theconsideration that certain of our cognitions rise completely above thesphere of all possible experience, and by means of conceptions, towhich there exists in the whole extent of experience no correspondingobject, seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds.And just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere, whereexperience affords us neither instruction nor guidance, lie theinvestigations of reason, which, on account of their importance, weconsider far preferable to, and as having a far more elevated aim than,all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuousphenomena. So high a value do we set upon these investigations, thateven at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permitneither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from thepursuit. These unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are God,freedom (of will), and immortality. The science which, with all itspreliminaries, has for its especial object the solution of theseproblems is named metaphysics—a science which is at the very outsetdogmatical, that is, it confidently takes upon itself the execution ofthis task without any previous investigation of the ability orinability of reason for such an undertaking.Now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned, it seemsnevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building withthe cognitions we possess, without knowing whence they come, and on thestrength of principles, the origin of which is undiscovered. Instead ofthus trying to build without a foundation, it is rather to be expectedthat we should long ago have put the question, how the understandingcan arrive at these à priori cognitions, and what is the extent,validity, and worth which they may possess? We say, “This is naturalenough,” meaning by the word natural, that which is consistent with ajust and reasonable way of thinking; but if we understand by the term,that which usually happens, nothing indeed could be more natural andmore comprehensible than that this investigation should be left longunattempted. For one part of our pure knowledge, the science ofmathematics, has been long firmly established, and thus leads us toform flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may beof quite a different nature. Besides, when we get beyond the bounds ofexperience, we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter; andthe charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that,unless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction, wehurry on undoubtingly in our course. This, however, may be avoided, ifwe are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, whichare not the less fictions on that account.Mathematical science affords us a brilliant example, how far,independently of all experience, we may carry our à priori knowledge.It is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects andcognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means ofintuition. But this circumstance is easily overlooked, because the saidintuition can itself be given à priori, and therefore is hardly to bedistinguished from a mere pure conception. Deceived by such a proof ofthe power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of ourknowledge. The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whoseresistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far morefree and rapid in airless space. Just in the same way did Plato,abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets tothe understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into thevoid space of pure intellect. He did not reflect that he made no realprogress by all his efforts; for he met with no resistance which mightserve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which hemight apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentumfor its progress. It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason inspeculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly aspossible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether thefoundation is a solid one or no. Arrived at this point, all sorts ofexcuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want ofstability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether withso late and dangerous an investigation. But what frees us during theprocess of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters usinto the belief of its solidity, is this. A great part, perhaps thegreatest part, of the business of our reason consists in theanalysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects. Bythis means we gain a multitude of cognitions, which although reallynothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which (though ina confused manner) was already thought in our conceptions, are, atleast in respect of their form, prized as new introspections; whilst,so far as regards their matter or content, we have really made noaddition to our conceptions, but only disinvolved them. But as thisprocess does furnish a real priori knowledge, which has a sure progressand useful results, reason, deceived by this, slips in, without beingitself aware of it, assertions of a quite different kind; in which, togiven conceptions it adds others, à priori indeed, but entirely foreignto them, without our knowing how it arrives at these, and, indeed,without such a question ever suggesting itself. I shall therefore atonce proceed to examine the difference between these two modes ofknowledge.IV. Of the Difference Between Analytical and Synthetical Judgements.In all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate iscogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here; the applicationto negative will be very easy), this relation is possible in twodifferent ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A, assomewhat which is contained (though covertly) in the conception A; orthe predicate B lies completely out of the conception A, although itstands in connection with it. In the first instance, I term thejudgement analytical, in the second, synthetical. Analytical judgements(affirmative) are therefore those in which the connection of thepredicate with the subject is cogitated through identity; those inwhich this connection is cogitated without identity, are calledsynthetical judgements. The former may be called explicative, thelatter augmentative judgements; because the former add in the predicatenothing to the conception of the subject, but only analyse it into itsconstituent conceptions, which were thought already in the subject,although in a confused manner; the latter add to our conceptions of thesubject a predicate which was not contained in it, and which noanalysis could ever have discovered therein. For example, when I say,“All bodies are extended,” this is an analytical judgement. For I neednot go beyond the conception of body in order to find extensionconnected with it, but merely analyse the conception, that is, becomeconscious of the manifold properties which I think in that conception,in order to discover this predicate in it: it is therefore ananalytical judgement. On the other hand, when I say, “All bodies areheavy,” the predicate is something totally different from that which Ithink in the mere conception of a body. By the addition of such apredicate, therefore, it becomes a synthetical judgement.Judgements of experience, as such, are always synthetical. For it wouldbe absurd to think of grounding an analytical judgement on experience,because in forming such a judgement I need not go out of the sphere ofmy conceptions, and therefore recourse to the testimony of experienceis quite unnecessary. That “bodies are extended” is not an empiricaljudgement, but a proposition which stands firm à priori. For beforeaddressing myself to experience, I already have in my conception allthe requisite conditions for the judgement, and I have only to extractthe predicate from the conception, according to the principle ofcontradiction, and thereby at the same time become conscious of thenecessity of the judgement, a necessity which I could never learn fromexperience. On the other hand, though at first I do not at all includethe predicate of weight in my conception of body in general, thatconception still indicates an object of experience, a part of thetotality of experience, to which I can still add other parts; and thisI do when I recognize by observation that bodies are heavy. I cancognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through thecharacteristics of extension, impenetrability, shape, etc., all whichare cogitated in this conception. But now I extend my knowledge, andlooking back on experience from which I had derived this conception ofbody, I find weight at all times connected with the abovecharacteristics, and therefore I synthetically add to my conceptionsthis as a predicate, and say, “All bodies are heavy.” Thus it isexperience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of thepredicate of weight with the conception of body, because bothconceptions, although the one is not contained in the other, stillbelong to one another (only contingently, however), as parts of awhole, namely, of experience, which is itself a synthesis ofintuitions.But to synthetical judgements à priori, such aid is entirely wanting.If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognizeanother B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on,whereby to render the synthesis possible? I have here no longer theadvantage of looking out in the sphere of experience for what I want.Let us take, for example, the proposition, “Everything that happens hasa cause.” In the conception of “something that happens,” I indeed thinkan existence which a certain time antecedes, and from this I can deriveanalytical judgements. But the conception of a cause lies quite out ofthe above conception, and indicates something entirely different from“that which happens,” and is consequently not contained in thatconception. How then am I able to assert concerning the generalconception—“that which happens”—something entirely different from thatconception, and to recognize the conception of cause although notcontained in it, yet as belonging to it, and even necessarily? what ishere the unknown = X, upon which the understanding rests when itbelieves it has found, out of the conception A a foreign predicate B,which it nevertheless considers to be connected with it? It cannot beexperience, because the principle adduced annexes the tworepresentations, cause and effect, to the representation existence, notonly with universality, which experience cannot give, but also with theexpression of necessity, therefore completely à priori and from pureconceptions. Upon such synthetical, that is augmentative propositions,depends the whole aim of our speculative knowledge à priori; foralthough analytical judgements are indeed highly important andnecessary, they are so, only to arrive at that clearness of conceptionswhich is requisite for a sure and extended synthesis, and this alone isa real acquisition.V. In all Theoretical Sciences of Reason, Synthetical Judgements “àpriori” are contained as Principles.1. Mathematical judgements are always synthetical. Hitherto this fact,though incontestably true and very important in its consequences, seemsto have escaped the analysts of the human mind, nay, to be in completeopposition to all their conjectures. For as it was found thatmathematical conclusions all proceed according to the principle ofcontradiction (which the nature of every apodeictic certaintyrequires), people became persuaded that the fundamental principles ofthe science also were recognized and admitted in the same way. But thenotion is fallacious; for although a synthetical proposition cancertainly be discerned by means of the principle of contradiction, thisis possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes, fromwhich the latter is deduced, but never of itself.Before all, be it observed, that proper mathematical propositions arealways judgements à priori, and not empirical, because they carry alongwith them the conception of necessity, which cannot be given byexperience. If this be demurred to, it matters not; I will then limitmy assertion to pure mathematics, the very conception of which impliesthat it consists of knowledge altogether non-empirical and à priori.We might, indeed at first suppose that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is amerely analytical proposition, following (according to the principle ofcontradiction) from the conception of a sum of seven and five. But ifwe regard it more narrowly, we find that our conception of the sum ofseven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sums intoone, whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number iswhich embraces both. The conception of twelve is by no means obtainedby merely cogitating the union of seven and five; and we may analyseour conception of such a possible sum as long as we will, still weshall never discover in it the notion of twelve. We must go beyondthese conceptions, and have recourse to an intuition which correspondsto one of the two—our five fingers, for example, or like Segner in hisArithmetic five points, and so by degrees, add the units contained inthe five given in the intuition, to the conception of seven. For Ifirst take the number 7, and, for the conception of 5 calling in theaid of the fingers of my hand as objects of intuition, I add the units,which I before took together to make up the number 5, gradually now bymeans of the material image my hand, to the number 7, and by thisprocess, I at length see the number 12 arise. That 7 should be added to5, I have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum = 7 + 5, butnot that this sum was equal to 12. Arithmetical propositions aretherefore always synthetical, of which we may become more clearlyconvinced by trying large numbers. For it will thus become quiteevident that, turn and twist our conceptions as we may, it isimpossible, without having recourse to intuition, to arrive at the sumtotal or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions. Justas little is any principle of pure geometry analytical. “A straightline between two points is the shortest,” is a synthetical proposition.For my conception of straight contains no notion of quantity, but ismerely qualitative. The conception of the shortest is therefore forewholly an addition, and by no analysis can it be extracted from ourconception of a straight line. Intuition must therefore here lend itsaid, by means of which, and thus only, our synthesis is possible.Some few principles preposited by geometricians are, indeed, reallyanalytical, and depend on the principle of contradiction. They serve,however, like identical propositions, as links in the chain of method,not as principles—for example, a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or(a+b) —> a, the whole is greater than its part. And yet even theseprinciples themselves, though they derive their validity from pureconceptions, are only admitted in mathematics because they can bepresented in intuition. What causes us here commonly to believe thatthe predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already contained in ourconception, and that the judgement is therefore analytical, is merelythe equivocal nature of the expression. We must join in thought acertain predicate to a given conception, and this necessity cleavesalready to the conception. But the question is, not what we must joinin thought to the given conception, but what we really think therein,though only obscurely, and then it becomes manifest that the predicatepertains to these conceptions, necessarily indeed, yet not as thoughtin the conception itself, but by virtue of an intuition, which must beadded to the conception.2. The science of natural philosophy (physics) contains in itselfsynthetical judgements à priori, as principles. I shall adduce twopropositions. For instance, the proposition, “In all changes of thematerial world, the quantity of matter remains unchanged”; or, that,“In all communication of motion, action and reaction must always beequal.” In both of these, not only is the necessity, and thereforetheir origin à priori clear, but also that they are syntheticalpropositions. For in the conception of matter, I do not cogitate itspermanency, but merely its presence in space, which it fills. Itherefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter, inorder to think on to it something à priori, which I did not think init. The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, andnevertheless conceived à priori; and so it is with regard to the otherpropositions of the pure part of natural philosophy.3. As to metaphysics, even if we look upon it merely as an attemptedscience, yet, from the nature of human reason, an indispensable one, wefind that it must contain synthetical propositions à priori. It is notmerely the duty of metaphysics to dissect, and thereby analytically toillustrate the conceptions which we form à priori of things; but weseek to widen the range of our à priori knowledge. For this purpose, wemust avail ourselves of such principles as add something to theoriginal conception—something not identical with, nor contained in it,and by means of synthetical judgements à priori, leave far behind usthe limits of experience; for example, in the proposition, “the worldmust have a beginning,” and such like. Thus metaphysics, according tothe proper aim of the science, consists merely of syntheticalpropositions à priori.VI. The Universal Problem of Pure Reason.It is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number ofinvestigations under the formula of a single problem. For in thismanner, we not only facilitate our own labour, inasmuch as we define itclearly to ourselves, but also render it more easy for others to decidewhether we have done justice to our undertaking. The proper problem ofpure reason, then, is contained in the question: “How are syntheticaljudgements à priori possible?”That metaphysical science has hitherto remained in so vacillating astate of uncertainty and contradiction, is only to be attributed to thefact that this great problem, and perhaps even the difference betweenanalytical and synthetical judgements, did not sooner suggest itself tophilosophers. Upon the solution of this problem, or upon sufficientproof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge à priori, dependsthe existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics. Amongphilosophers, David Hume came the nearest of all to this problem; yetit never acquired in his mind sufficient precision, nor did he regardthe question in its universality. On the contrary, he stopped short atthe synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with itscause (principium causalitatis), insisting that such proposition àpriori was impossible. According to his conclusions, then, all that weterm metaphysical science is a mere delusion, arising from the fanciedinsight of reason into that which is in truth borrowed from experience,and to which habit has given the appearance of necessity. Against thisassertion, destructive to all pure philosophy, he would have beenguarded, had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality.For he would then have perceived that, according to his own argument,there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science, whichassuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions à priori—anabsurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him.In the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehendedthe possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation andconstruction of all sciences which contain theoretical knowledge àpriori of objects, that is to say, the answer to the followingquestions:How is pure mathematical science possible?How is pure natural science possible?Respecting these sciences, as they do certainly exist, it may withpropriety be asked, how they are possible?—for that they must bepossible is shown by the fact of their really existing.[9] But as tometaphysics, the miserable progress it has hitherto made, and the factthat of no one system yet brought forward, far as regards its true aim,can it be said that this science really exists, leaves any one atliberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of its existence. [9] As to the existence of pure natural science, or physics, perhaps many may still express doubts. But we have only to look at the different propositions which are commonly treated of at the commencement of proper (empirical) physical science—those, for example, relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter, the vis inertiae, the equality of action and reaction, etc.—to be soon convinced that they form a science of pure physics (physica pura, or rationalis), which well deserves to be separately exposed as a special science, in its whole extent, whether that be great or confined.Yet, in a certain sense, this kind of knowledge must unquestionably belooked upon as given; in other words, metaphysics must be considered asreally existing, if not as a science, nevertheless as a naturaldisposition of the human mind (metaphysica naturalis). For humanreason, without any instigations imputable to the mere vanity of greatknowledge, unceasingly progresses, urged on by its own feeling of need,towards such questions as cannot be answered by any empiricalapplication of reason, or principles derived therefrom; and so therehas ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics. Itwill always exist, so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of itspower of speculation. And now the question arises: “How is metaphysics,as a natural disposition, possible?” In other words, how, from thenature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which purereason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feelingof need to answer as well as it can?But as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions whichreason is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself, forexample, whether the world had a beginning, or has existed frometernity, it has always met with unavoidable contradictions, we mustnot rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition of the mind tometaphysics, that is, with the existence of the faculty of pure reason,whence, indeed, some sort of metaphysical system always arises; but itmust be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the questionwhether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats.We must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of itsquestions, or on the ability or inability of reason to form anyjudgement respecting them; and therefore either to extend withconfidence the bounds of our pure reason, or to set strictly definedand safe limits to its action. This last question, which arises out ofthe above universal problem, would properly run thus: “How ismetaphysics possible as a science?”Thus, the critique of reason leads at last, naturally and necessarily,to science; and, on the other hand, the dogmatical use of reasonwithout criticism leads to groundless assertions, against which othersequally specious can always be set, thus ending unavoidably inscepticism.Besides, this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity,because it has not to do with objects of reason, the variety of whichis inexhaustible, but merely with Reason herself and her problems;problems which arise out of her own bosom, and are not proposed to herby the nature of outward things, but by her own nature. And when onceReason has previously become able completely to understand her ownpower in regard to objects which she meets with in experience, it willbe easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her attemptedapplication to objects beyond the confines of experience.We may and must, therefore, regard the attempts hitherto made toestablish metaphysical science dogmatically as non-existent. For whatof analysis, that is, mere dissection of conceptions, is contained inone or other, is not the aim of, but only a preparation for metaphysicsproper, which has for its object the extension, by means of synthesis,of our à priori knowledge. And for this purpose, mere analysis is ofcourse useless, because it only shows what is contained in theseconceptions, but not how we arrive, à priori, at them; and this it isher duty to show, in order to be able afterwards to determine theirvalid use in regard to all objects of experience, to all knowledge ingeneral. But little self-denial, indeed, is needed to give up thesepretensions, seeing the undeniable, and in the dogmatic mode ofprocedure, inevitable contradictions of Reason with herself, have longsince ruined the reputation of every system of metaphysics that hasappeared up to this time. It will require more firmness to remainundeterred by difficulty from within, and opposition from without, fromendeavouring, by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed,to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable tohuman reason—a science from which every branch it has borne may be cutaway, but whose roots remain indestructible.VII. Idea and Division of a Particular Science, under the Name of aCritique of Pure Reason.From all that has been said, there results the idea of a particularscience, which may be called the Critique of Pure Reason. For reason isthe faculty which furnishes us with the principles of knowledge àpriori. Hence, pure reason is the faculty which contains the principlesof cognizing anything absolutely à priori. An organon of pure reasonwould be a compendium of those principles according to which alone allpure cognitions à priori can be obtained. The completely extendedapplication of such an organon would afford us a system of pure reason.As this, however, is demanding a great deal, and it is yet doubtfulwhether any extension of our knowledge be here possible, or, if so, inwhat cases; we can regard a science of the mere criticism of purereason, its sources and limits, as the propædeutic to a system of purereason. Such a science must not be called a doctrine, but only acritique of pure reason; and its use, in regard to speculation, wouldbe only negative, not to enlarge the bounds of, but to purify, ourreason, and to shield it against error—which alone is no little gain. Iapply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is not so muchoccupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of theseobjects, so far as this mode of cognition is possible à priori. Asystem of such conceptions would be called transcendental philosophy.But this, again, is still beyond the bounds of our present essay. Foras such a science must contain a complete exposition not only of oursynthetical à priori, but of our analytical à priori knowledge, it isof too wide a range for our present purpose, because we do not requireto carry our analysis any farther than is necessary to understand, intheir full extent, the principles of synthesis à priori, with whichalone we have to do. This investigation, which we cannot properly calla doctrine, but only a transcendental critique, because it aims not atthe enlargement, but at the correction and guidance, of our knowledge,and is to serve as a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of allknowledge à priori, is the sole object of our present essay. Such acritique is consequently, as far as possible, a preparation for anorganon; and if this new organon should be found to fail, at least fora canon of pure reason, according to which the complete system of thephilosophy of pure reason, whether it extend or limit the bounds ofthat reason, might one day be set forth both analytically andsynthetically. For that this is possible, nay, that such a system isnot of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its ever beingcompleted, is evident. For we have not here to do with the nature ofoutward objects, which is infinite, but solely with the mind, whichjudges of the nature of objects, and, again, with the mind only inrespect of its cognition à priori. And the object of ourinvestigations, as it is not to be sought without, but, altogetherwithin, ourselves, cannot remain concealed, and in all probability islimited enough to be completely surveyed and fairly estimated,according to its worth or worthlessness. Still less let the reader hereexpect a critique of books and systems of pure reason; our presentobject is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself.Only when we make this critique our foundation, do we possess a puretouchstone for estimating the philosophical value of ancient and modernwritings on this subject; and without this criterion, the incompetenthistorian or judge decides upon and corrects the groundless assertionsof others with his own, which have themselves just as littlefoundation.Transcendental philosophy is the idea of a science, for which theCritique of Pure Reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically,that is, from principles, with a full guarantee for the validity andstability of all the parts which enter into the building. It is thesystem of all the principles of pure reason. If this Critique itselfdoes not assume the title of transcendental philosophy, it is onlybecause, to be a complete system, it ought to contain a full analysisof all human knowledge à priori. Our critique must, indeed, lay beforeus a complete enumeration of all the radical conceptions whichconstitute the said pure knowledge. But from the complete analysis ofthese conceptions themselves, as also from a complete investigation ofthose derived from them, it abstains with reason; partly because itwould be deviating from the end in view to occupy itself with thisanalysis, since this process is not attended with the difficulty andinsecurity to be found in the synthesis, to which our critique isentirely devoted, and partly because it would be inconsistent with theunity of our plan to burden this essay with the vindication of thecompleteness of such an analysis and deduction, with which, after all,we have at present nothing to do. This completeness of the analysis ofthese radical conceptions, as well as of the deduction from theconceptions à priori which may be given by the analysis, we can,however, easily attain, provided only that we are in possession of allthese radical conceptions, which are to serve as principles of thesynthesis, and that in respect of this main purpose nothing is wanting.To the Critique of Pure Reason, therefore, belongs all that constitutestranscendental philosophy; and it is the complete idea oftranscendental philosophy, but still not the science itself; because itonly proceeds so far with the analysis as is necessary to the power ofjudging completely of our synthetical knowledge à priori.The principal thing we must attend to, in the division of the parts ofa science like this, is that no conceptions must enter it which containaught empirical; in other words, that the knowledge à priori must becompletely pure. Hence, although the highest principles and fundamentalconceptions of morality are certainly cognitions à priori, yet they donot belong to transcendental philosophy; because, though they certainlydo not lay the conceptions of pain, pleasure, desires, inclinations,etc. (which are all of empirical origin), at the foundation of itsprecepts, yet still into the conception of duty—as an obstacle to beovercome, or as an incitement which should not be made into amotive—these empirical conceptions must necessarily enter, in theconstruction of a system of pure morality. Transcendental philosophy isconsequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason.For all that is practical, so far as it contains motives, relates tofeelings, and these belong to empirical sources of cognition.If we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of ascience in general, it ought to comprehend, first, a Doctrine of theElements, and, secondly, a Doctrine of the Method of pure reason. Eachof these main divisions will have its subdivisions, the separatereasons for which we cannot here particularize. Only so much seemsnecessary, by way of introduction of premonition, that there are twosources of human knowledge (which probably spring from a common, but tous unknown root), namely, sense and understanding. By the former,objects are given to us; by the latter, thought. So far as the facultyof sense may contain representations à priori, which form theconditions under which objects are given, in so far it belongs totranscendental philosophy. The transcendental doctrine of sense mustform the first part of our science of elements, because the conditionsunder which alone the objects of human knowledge are given must precedethose under which they are thought.I. TRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF ELEMENTS.FIRST PART. TRANSCENDENTAL ÆSTHETIC.§ I. Introductory.In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate toobjects, it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which itimmediately relates to them is by means of an intuition. To this as theindispensable groundwork, all thought points. But an intuition can takeplace only in so far as the object is given to us. This, again, is onlypossible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mindin a certain manner. The capacity for receiving representations(receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects,objects, is called sensibility. By means of sensibility, therefore,objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; bythe understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions. Butan thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs,relate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility,because in no other way can an object be given to us.The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far aswe are affected by the said object, is sensation. That sort ofintuition which relates to an object by means of sensation is called anempirical intuition. The undetermined object of an empirical intuitionis called phenomenon. That which in the phenomenon corresponds to thesensation, I term its matter; but that which effects that the contentof the phenomenon can be arranged under certain relations, I call itsform. But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and bywhich they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itselfsensation. It is, then, the matter of all phenomena that is given to usà posteriori; the form must lie ready à priori for them in the mind,and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation.I call all representations pure, in the transcendental meaning of theword, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation. Andaccordingly we find existing in the mind à priori, the pure form ofsensuous intuitions in general, in which all the manifold content ofthe phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations.This pure form of sensibility I shall call pure intuition. Thus, if Itake away from our representation of a body all that the understandingthinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, etc., andalso whatever belongs to sensation, as impenetrability, hardness,colour, etc.; yet there is still something left us from this empiricalintuition, namely, extension and shape. These belong to pure intuition,which exists à priori in the mind, as a mere form of sensibility, andwithout any real object of the senses or any sensation.The science of all the principles of sensibility à priori, I calltranscendental æsthetic.[10] There must, then, be such a scienceforming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, incontradistinction to that part which contains the principles of purethought, and which is called transcendental logic. [10] The Germans are the only people who at present use this word to indicate what others call the critique of taste. At the foundation of this term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst, Baumgarten, conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science. But his endeavours were vain. For the said rules or criteria are, in respect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never can serve as determinate laws à priori, by which our judgement in matters of taste is to be directed. It is rather our judgement which forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles. On this account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating the critique of taste, and to apply it solely to that doctrine, which is true science—the science of the laws of sensibility—and thus come nearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their well-known division of the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai noeta, or to share it with speculative philosophy, and employ it partly in a transcendental, partly in a psychological signification.In the science of transcendental æsthetic accordingly, we shall firstisolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty, by separating from it allthat is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding,so that nothing be left but empirical intuition. In the next place weshall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, sothat nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form ofphenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford à priori. Fromthis investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms ofsensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge à priori, namely, spaceand time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed.SECTION I. Of Space.§ 2. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.By means of the external sense (a property of the mind), we representto ourselves objects as without us, and these all in space. Hereinalone are their shape, dimensions, and relations to each otherdetermined or determinable. The internal sense, by means of which themind contemplates itself or its internal state, gives, indeed, nointuition of the soul as an object; yet there is nevertheless adeterminate form, under which alone the contemplation of our internalstate is possible, so that all which relates to the inwarddeterminations of the mind is represented in relations of time. Of timewe cannot have any external intuition, any more than we can have aninternal intuition of space. What then are time and space? Are theyreal existences? Or, are they merely relations or determinations ofthings, such, however, as would equally belong to these things inthemselves, though they should never become objects of intuition; or,are they such as belong only to the form of intuition, and consequentlyto the subjective constitution of the mind, without which thesepredicates of time and space could not be attached to any object? Inorder to become informed on these points, we shall first give anexposition of the conception of space. By exposition, I mean the clear,though not detailed, representation of that which belongs to aconception; and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains thatwhich represents the conception as given à priori.1. Space is not a conception which has been derived from outwardexperiences. For, in order that certain sensations may relate tosomething without me (that is, to something which occupies a differentpart of space from that in which I am); in like manner, in order that Imay represent them not merely as without, of, and near to each other,but also in separate places, the representation of space must alreadyexist as a foundation. Consequently, the representation of space cannotbe borrowed from the relations of external phenomena throughexperience; but, on the contrary, this external experience is itselfonly possible through the said antecedent representation.2. Space then is a necessary representation à priori, which serves forthe foundation of all external intuitions. We never can imagine or makea representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though wemay easily enough think that no objects are found in it. It must,therefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility ofphenomena, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and isa representation à priori, which necessarily supplies the basis forexternal phenomena.3. Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of therelations of things, but a pure intuition. For, in the first place, wecan only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of diversspaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, theseparts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the componentparts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitatedonly as existing in it. Space is essentially one, and multiplicity init, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space,depends solely upon limitations. Hence it follows that an à prioriintuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all ourconceptions of space. Thus, moreover, the principles of geometry—forexample, that “in a triangle, two sides together are greater than thethird,” are never deduced from general conceptions of line andtriangle, but from intuition, and this à priori, with apodeicticcertainty.4. Space is represented as an infinite given quantity. Now everyconception must indeed be considered as a representation which iscontained in an infinite multitude of different possiblerepresentations, which, therefore, comprises these under itself; but noconception, as such, can be so conceived, as if it contained withinitself an infinite multitude of representations. Nevertheless, space isso conceived of, for all parts of space are equally capable of beingproduced to infinity. Consequently, the original representation ofspace is an intuition à priori, and not a conception.§ 3. Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Space.By a transcendental exposition, I mean the explanation of a conception,as a principle, whence can be discerned the possibility of othersynthetical à priori cognitions. For this purpose, it is requisite,firstly, that such cognitions do really flow from the given conception;and, secondly, that the said cognitions are only possible under thepresupposition of a given mode of explaining this conception.Geometry is a science which determines the properties of spacesynthetically, and yet à priori. What, then, must be our representationof space, in order that such a cognition of it may be possible? It mustbe originally intuition, for from a mere conception, no propositionscan be deduced which go out beyond the conception, and yet this happensin geometry. (Introd. V.) But this intuition must be found in the mindà priori, that is, before any perception of objects, consequently mustbe pure, not empirical, intuition. For geometrical principles arealways apodeictic, that is, united with the consciousness of theirnecessity, as: “Space has only three dimensions.” But propositions ofthis kind cannot be empirical judgements, nor conclusions from them.(Introd. II.) Now, how can an external intuition anterior to objectsthemselves, and in which our conception of objects can be determined àpriori, exist in the human mind? Obviously not otherwise than in so faras it has its seat in the subject only, as the formal capacity of thesubject’s being affected by objects, and thereby of obtaining immediaterepresentation, that is, intuition; consequently, only as the form ofthe external sense in general.Thus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility ofgeometry, as a synthetical science à priori, becomes comprehensible.Every mode of explanation which does not show us this possibility,although in appearance it may be similar to ours, can with the utmostcertainty be distinguished from it by these marks.§ 4. Conclusions from the foregoing Conceptions.(a) Space does not represent any property of objects as things inthemselves, nor does it represent them in their relations to eachother; in other words, space does not represent to us any determinationof objects such as attaches to the objects themselves, and wouldremain, even though all subjective conditions of the intuition wereabstracted. For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objectscan be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which theybelong, and therefore not à priori.(b) Space is nothing else than the form of all phenomena of theexternal sense, that is, the subjective condition of the sensibility,under which alone external intuition is possible. Now, because thereceptivity or capacity of the subject to be affected by objectsnecessarily antecedes all intuitions of these objects, it is easilyunderstood how the form of all phenomena can be given in the mindprevious to all actual perceptions, therefore à priori, and how it, asa pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, can containprinciples of the relations of these objects prior to all experience.It is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak ofspace, extended objects, etc. If we depart from the subjectivecondition, under which alone we can obtain external intuition, or, inother words, by means of which we are affected by objects, therepresentation of space has no meaning whatsoever. This predicate isonly applicable to things in so far as they appear to us, that is, areobjects of sensibility. The constant form of this receptivity, which wecall sensibility, is a necessary condition of all relations in whichobjects can be intuited as existing without us, and when abstraction ofthese objects is made, is a pure intuition, to which we give the nameof space. It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions ofsensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only ofthe possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena. And sowe may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to usexternally, but not all things considered as things in themselves, bethey intuited or not, or by whatsoever subject one will. As to theintuitions of other thinking beings, we cannot judge whether they areor are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition,and which for us are universally valid. If we join the limitation of ajudgement to the conception of the subject, then the judgement willpossess unconditioned validity. For example, the proposition, “Allobjects are beside each other in space,” is valid only under thelimitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuousintuition. But if I join the condition to the conception and say, “Allthings, as external phenomena, are beside each other in space,” thenthe rule is valid universally, and without any limitation. Ourexpositions, consequently, teach the reality (i.e., the objectivevalidity) of space in regard of all which can be presented to usexternally as object, and at the same time also the ideality of spacein regard to objects when they are considered by means of reason asthings in themselves, that is, without reference to the constitution ofour sensibility. We maintain, therefore, the empirical reality of spacein regard to all possible external experience, although we must admitits transcendental ideality; in other words, that it is nothing, sosoon as we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of allexperience depends and look upon space as something that belongs tothings in themselves.But, with the exception of space, there is no representation,subjective and referring to something external to us, which could becalled objective à priori. For there are no other subjectiverepresentations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions àpriori, as we can from the intuition of space. (See § 3.) Therefore, tospeak accurately, no ideality whatever belongs to these, although theyagree in this respect with the representation of space, that theybelong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuousperception; such a mode, for example, as that of sight, of hearing, andof feeling, by means of the sensations of colour, sound, and heat, butwhich, because they are only sensations and not intuitions, do not ofthemselves give us the cognition of any object, least of all, an àpriori cognition. My purpose, in the above remark, is merely this: toguard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space byexamples quite insufficient, for example, by colour, taste, etc.; forthese must be contemplated not as properties of things, but only aschanges in the subject, changes which may be different in differentmen. For, in such a case, that which is originally a mere phenomenon, arose, for example, is taken by the empirical understanding for a thingin itself, though to every different eye, in respect of its colour, itmay appear different. On the contrary, the transcendental conception ofphenomena in space is a critical admonition, that, in general, nothingwhich is intuited in space is a thing in itself, and that space is nota form which belongs as a property to things; but that objects arequite unknown to us in themselves, and what we call outward objects,are nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility, whoseform is space, but whose real correlate, the thing in itself, is notknown by means of these representations, nor ever can be, butrespecting which, in experience, no inquiry is ever made.SECTION II. Of Time.§ 5. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.1. Time is not an empirical conception. For neither coexistence norsuccession would be perceived by us, if the representation of time didnot exist as a foundation à priori. Without this presupposition wecould not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one andthe same time, or at different times, that is, contemporaneously, or insuccession.2. Time is a necessary representation, lying at the foundation of allour intuitions. With regard to phenomena in general, we cannot thinkaway time from them, and represent them to ourselves as out of andunconnected with time, but we can quite well represent to ourselvestime void of phenomena. Time is therefore given à priori. In it aloneis all reality of phenomena possible. These may all be annihilated inthought, but time itself, as the universal condition of theirpossibility, cannot be so annulled.3. On this necessity à priori is also founded the possibility ofapodeictic principles of the relations of time, or axioms of time ingeneral, such as: “Time has only one dimension,” “Different times arenot coexistent but successive” (as different spaces are not successivebut coexistent). These principles cannot be derived from experience,for it would give neither strict universality, nor apodeicticcertainty. We should only be able to say, “so common experience teachesus,” but not “it must be so.” They are valid as rules, through which,in general, experience is possible; and they instruct us respectingexperience, and not by means of it.4. Time is not a discursive, or as it is called, general conception,but a pure form of the sensuous intuition. Different times are merelyparts of one and the same time. But the representation which can onlybe given by a single object is an intuition. Besides, the propositionthat different times cannot be coexistent could not be derived from ageneral conception. For this proposition is synthetical, and thereforecannot spring out of conceptions alone. It is therefore containedimmediately in the intuition and representation of time.5. The infinity of time signifies nothing more than that everydetermined quantity of time is possible only through limitations of onetime lying at the foundation. Consequently, the originalrepresentation, time, must be given as unlimited. But as thedeterminate representation of the parts of time and of every quantityof an object can only be obtained by limitation, the completerepresentation of time must not be furnished by means of conceptions,for these contain only partial representations. Conceptions, on thecontrary, must have immediate intuition for their basis.§ 6 Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Time.I may here refer to what is said above (§ 5, 3), where, for or sake ofbrevity, I have placed under the head of metaphysical exposition, thatwhich is properly transcendental. Here I shall add that the conceptionof change, and with it the conception of motion, as change of place, ispossible only through and in the representation of time; that if thisrepresentation were not an intuition (internal) à priori, noconception, of whatever kind, could render comprehensible thepossibility of change, in other words, of a conjunction ofcontradictorily opposed predicates in one and the same object, forexample, the presence of a thing in a place and the non-presence of thesame thing in the same place. It is only in time that it is possible tomeet with two contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing, thatis, after each other. Thus our conception of time explains thepossibility of so much synthetical knowledge à priori, as is exhibitedin the general doctrine of motion, which is not a little fruitful.§ 7. Conclusions from the above Conceptions.(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres inthings as an objective determination, and therefore remains, whenabstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition ofthings. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet withoutpresenting to any power of perception any real object. In the lattercase, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, itcould not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned orintuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this isquite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective conditionunder which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this formof the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, andconsequently à priori.(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is,of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot beany determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shapenor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation ofrepresentations in our internal state. And precisely because thisinternal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour tosupply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by aline progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a serieswhich is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties ofthis line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception,that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time aresuccessive. From this it is clear also that the representation of timeis itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed inan external intuition.(c) Time is the formal condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever.Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as acondition à priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand,because all representations, whether they have or have not externalthings for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of themind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state issubject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, totime—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—theimmediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate conditionof all external phenomena. If I can say à priori, “All outwardphenomena are in space, and determined à priori according to therelations of space,” I can also, from the principle of the internalsense, affirm universally, “All phenomena in general, that is, allobjects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relationsof time.”If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all externalintuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition andpresented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently takeobjects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only ofobjective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are thingswhich we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we,make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words,of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak ofthings in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition ofour (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as weare affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind orsubject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena,consequently of all things which come within the sphere of ourexperience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, “All things arein time,” because in this conception of things in general, we abstractand make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is theproper condition under which time belongs to our representation ofobjects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, “Allthings, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are intime,” then the proposition has its sound objective validity anduniversality à priori.What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality oftime; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects whichcan ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is alwayssensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, whichdoes not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we denyto time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it,without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutelyinheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belongto objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us throughthe medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, thetranscendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract thesubjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannotbe reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things inthemselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. Thisideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated byfallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in sucharguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that thephenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objectivereality, while in this case we can only find such an objective realityas is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a merephenomenon. In reference to this subject, see the remark in Section I(§ 4)§ 8. Elucidation.Against this theory, which grants empirical reality to time, but deniesto it absolute and transcendental reality, I have heard fromintelligent men an objection so unanimously urged that I conclude thatit must naturally present itself to every reader to whom theseconsiderations are novel. It runs thus: “Changes are real” (this thecontinual change in our own representations demonstrates, even thoughthe existence of all external phenomena, together with their changes,is denied). Now, changes are only possible in time, and therefore timemust be something real. But there is no difficulty in answering this. Igrant the whole argument. Time, no doubt, is something real, that is,it is the real form of our internal intuition. It therefore hassubjective reality, in reference to our internal experience, that is, Ihave really the representation of time and of my determinationstherein. Time, therefore, is not to be regarded as an object, but asthe mode of representation of myself as an object. But if I couldintuite myself, or be intuited by another being, without this conditionof sensibility, then those very determinations which we now representto ourselves as changes, would present to us a knowledge in which therepresentation of time, and consequently of change, would not appear.The empirical reality of time, therefore, remains, as the condition ofall our experience. But absolute reality, according to what has beensaid above, cannot be granted it. Time is nothing but the form of ourinternal intuition.[11] If we take away from it the special conditionof our sensibility, the conception of time also vanishes; and itinheres not in the objects themselves, but solely in the subject (ormind) which intuites them. [11] I can indeed say “my representations follow one another, or are successive”; but this means only that we are conscious of them as in a succession, that is, according to the form of the internal sense. Time, therefore, is not a thing in itself, nor is it any objective determination pertaining to, or inherent in things.But the reason why this objection is so unanimously brought against ourdoctrine of time, and that too by disputants who cannot start anyintelligible arguments against the doctrine of the ideality of space,is this—they have no hope of demonstrating apodeictically the absolutereality of space, because the doctrine of idealism is against them,according to which the reality of external objects is not capable ofany strict proof. On the other hand, the reality of the object of ourinternal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clearimmediately through consciousness. The former—external objects inspace—might be a mere delusion, but the latter—the object of myinternal perception—is undeniably real. They do not, however, reflectthat both, without question of their reality as representations, belongonly to the genus phenomenon, which has always two aspects, the one,the object considered as a thing in itself, without regard to the modeof intuiting it, and the nature of which remains for this very reasonproblematical, the other, the form of our intuition of the object,which must be sought not in the object as a thing in itself, but in thesubject to which it appears—which form of intuition neverthelessbelongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object.Time and space are, therefore, two sources of knowledge, from which, àpriori, various synthetical cognitions can be drawn. Of this we find astriking example in the cognitions of space and its relations, whichform the foundation of pure mathematics. They are the two pure forms ofall intuitions, and thereby make synthetical propositions à prioripossible. But these sources of knowledge being merely conditions of oursensibility, do therefore, and as such, strictly determine their ownrange and purpose, in that they do not and cannot present objects asthings in themselves, but are applicable to them solely in so far asthey are considered as sensuous phenomena. The sphere of phenomena isthe only sphere of their validity, and if we venture out of this, nofurther objective use can be made of them. For the rest, this formalreality of time and space leaves the validity of our empiricalknowledge unshaken; for our certainty in that respect is equally firm,whether these forms necessarily inhere in the things themselves, oronly in our intuitions of them. On the other hand, those who maintainthe absolute reality of time and space, whether as essentiallysubsisting, or only inhering, as modifications, in things, must findthemselves at utter variance with the principles of experience itself.For, if they decide for the first view, and make space and time intosubstances, this being the side taken by mathematical naturalphilosophers, they must admit two self-subsisting nonentities, infiniteand eternal, which exist (yet without there being anything real) forthe purpose of containing in themselves everything that is real. Ifthey adopt the second view of inherence, which is preferred by somemetaphysical natural philosophers, and regard space and time asrelations (contiguity in space or succession in time), abstracted fromexperience, though represented confusedly in this state of separation,they find themselves in that case necessitated to deny the validity ofmathematical doctrines à priori in reference to real things (forexample, in space)—at all events their apodeictic certainty. For suchcertainty cannot be found in an à posteriori proposition; and theconceptions à priori of space and time are, according to this opinion,mere creations of the imagination, having their source really inexperience, inasmuch as, out of relations abstracted from experience,imagination has made up something which contains, indeed, generalstatements of these relations, yet of which no application can be madewithout the restrictions attached thereto by nature. The former ofthese parties gains this advantage, that they keep the sphere ofphenomena free for mathematical science. On the other hand, these veryconditions (space and time) embarrass them greatly, when theunderstanding endeavours to pass the limits of that sphere. The latterhas, indeed, this advantage, that the representations of space and timedo not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects, not asphenomena, but merely in their relation to the understanding. Devoid,however, of a true and objectively valid à priori intuition, they canneither furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematicalcognitions à priori, nor bring the propositions of experience intonecessary accordance with those of mathematics. In our theory of thetrue nature of these two original forms of the sensibility, bothdifficulties are surmounted.In conclusion, that transcendental æsthetic cannot contain any morethan these two elements—space and time, is sufficiently obvious fromthe fact that all other conceptions appertaining to sensibility, eventhat of motion, which unites in itself both elements, presupposesomething empirical. Motion, for example, presupposes the perception ofsomething movable. But space considered in itself contains nothingmovable, consequently motion must be something which is found in spaceonly through experience—in other words, an empirical datum. In likemanner, transcendental æsthetic cannot number the conception of changeamong its data à priori; for time itself does not change, but onlysomething which is in time. To acquire the conception of change,therefore, the perception of some existing object and of the successionof its determinations, in one word, experience, is necessary.§ 9. General Remarks on Transcendental Æsthetic.I. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, it will be requisite, inthe first place, to recapitulate, as clearly as possible, what ouropinion is with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuouscognition in general. We have intended, then, to say that all ourintuition is nothing but the representation of phenomena; that thethings which we intuite, are not in themselves the same as ourrepresentations of them in intuition, nor are their relations inthemselves so constituted as they appear to us; and that if we takeaway the subject, or even only the subjective constitution of oursenses in general, then not only the nature and relations of objects inspace and time, but even space and time themselves disappear; and thatthese, as phenomena, cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. Whatmay be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves andwithout reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quiteunknown to us. We know nothing more than our mode of perceiving them,which is peculiar to us, and which, though not of necessity pertainingto every animated being, is so to the whole human race. With this alonewe have to do. Space and time are the pure forms thereof; sensation thematter. The former alone can we cognize à priori, that is, antecedentto all actual perception; and for this reason such cognition is calledpure intuition. The latter is that in our cognition which is calledcognition à posteriori, that is, empirical intuition. The formerappertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility, of whatsoeverkind our sensations may be; the latter may be of very diversifiedcharacter. Supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition evento the very highest degree of clearness, we should not thereby advanceone step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as thingsin themselves. For we could only, at best, arrive at a completecognition of our own mode of intuition, that is of our sensibility, andthis always under the conditions originally attaching to the subject,namely, the conditions of space and time; while the question: “What areobjects considered as things in themselves?” remains unanswerable evenafter the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world.To say, then, that all our sensibility is nothing but the confusedrepresentation of things containing exclusively that which belongs tothem as things in themselves, and this under an accumulation ofcharacteristic marks and partial representations which we cannotdistinguish in consciousness, is a falsification of the conception ofsensibility and phenomenization, which renders our whole doctrinethereof empty and useless. The difference between a confused and aclear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do withcontent. No doubt the conception of right, as employed by a soundunderstanding, contains all that the most subtle investigation couldunfold from it, although, in the ordinary practical use of the word, weare not conscious of the manifold representations comprised in theconception. But we cannot for this reason assert that the ordinaryconception is a sensuous one, containing a mere phenomenon, for rightcannot appear as a phenomenon; but the conception of it lies in theunderstanding, and represents a property (the moral property) ofactions, which belongs to them in themselves. On the other hand, therepresentation in intuition of a body contains nothing which couldbelong to an object considered as a thing in itself, but merely thephenomenon or appearance of something, and the mode in which we areaffected by that appearance; and this receptivity of our faculty ofcognition is called sensibility, and remains toto caelo different fromthe cognition of an object in itself, even though we should examine thecontent of the phenomenon to the very bottom.It must be admitted that the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy has assignedan entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into thenature and origin of our cognitions, inasmuch as it regards thedistinction between the sensuous and the intellectual as merelylogical, whereas it is plainly transcendental, and concerns not merelythe clearness or obscurity, but the content and origin of both. For thefaculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinctand confused cognition of objects as things in themselves, but, infact, gives us no knowledge of these at all. On the contrary, so soonas we abstract in thought our own subjective nature, the objectrepresented, with the properties ascribed to it by sensuous intuition,entirely disappears, because it was only this subjective nature thatdetermined the form of the object as a phenomenon.In phenomena, we commonly, indeed, distinguish that which essentiallybelongs to the intuition of them, and is valid for the sensuous facultyof every human being, from that which belongs to the same intuitionaccidentally, as valid not for the sensuous faculty in general, but fora particular state or organization of this or that sense. Accordingly,we are accustomed to say that the former is a cognition whichrepresents the object itself, whilst the latter presents only aparticular appearance or phenomenon thereof. This distinction, however,is only empirical. If we stop here (as is usual), and do not regard theempirical intuition as itself a mere phenomenon (as we ought to do), inwhich nothing that can appertain to a thing in itself is to be found,our transcendental distinction is lost, and we believe that we cognizeobjects as things in themselves, although in the whole range of thesensuous world, investigate the nature of its objects as profoundly aswe may, we have to do with nothing but phenomena. Thus, we call therainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower, and therain, the reality or thing in itself; and this is right enough, if weunderstand the latter conception in a merely physical sense, that is,as that which in universal experience, and under whatever conditions ofsensuous perception, is known in intuition to be so and so determined,and not otherwise. But if we consider this empirical datum generally,and inquire, without reference to its accordance with all our senses,whether there can be discovered in it aught which represents an objectas a thing in itself (the raindrops of course are not such, for theyare, as phenomena, empirical objects), the question of the relation ofthe representation to the object is transcendental; and not only arethe raindrops mere phenomena, but even their circular form, nay, thespace itself through which they fall, is nothing in itself, but bothare mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuousintuition, whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterlyunknown.The second important concern of our æsthetic is that it does not obtainfavour merely as a plausible hypothesis, but possess as undoubted acharacter of certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is toserve for an organon. In order fully to convince the reader of thiscertainty, we shall select a case which will serve to make its validityapparent, and also to illustrate what has been said in § 3.Suppose, then, that space and time are in themselves objective, andconditions of the—possibility of objects as things in themselves. Inthe first place, it is evident that both present us, with very manyapodeictic and synthetic propositions à priori, but especiallyspace—and for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation atpresent. As the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically àpriori, and with apodeictic certainty, I inquire: Whence do you obtainpropositions of this kind, and on what basis does the understandingrest, in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universallyvalid truths?There is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions, as such;and these are given either à priori or à posteriori. The latter,namely, empirical conceptions, together with the empirical intuition onwhich they are founded, cannot afford any synthetical proposition,except such as is itself also empirical, that is, a proposition ofexperience. But an empirical proposition cannot possess the qualitiesof necessity and absolute universality, which, nevertheless, are thecharacteristics of all geometrical propositions. As to the first andonly means to arrive at such cognitions, namely, through mereconceptions or intuitions à priori, it is quite clear that from mereconceptions no synthetical cognitions, but only analytical ones, can beobtained. Take, for example, the proposition: “Two straight linescannot enclose a space, and with these alone no figure is possible,”and try to deduce it from the conception of a straight line and thenumber two; or take the proposition: “It is possible to construct afigure with three straight lines,” and endeavour, in like manner, todeduce it from the mere conception of a straight line and the numberthree. All your endeavours are in vain, and you find yourself forced tohave recourse to intuition, as, in fact, geometry always does. Youtherefore give yourself an object in intuition. But of what kind isthis intuition? Is it a pure à priori, or is it an empirical intuition?If the latter, then neither an universally valid, much less anapodeictic proposition can arise from it, for experience never can giveus any such proposition. You must, therefore, give yourself an object àpriori in intuition, and upon that ground your synthetical proposition.Now if there did not exist within you a faculty of intuition à priori;if this subjective condition were not in respect to its form also theuniversal condition à priori under which alone the object of thisexternal intuition is itself possible; if the object (that is, thetriangle) were something in itself, without relation to you thesubject; how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in yoursubjective conditions in order to construct a triangle, must alsonecessarily belong to the triangle in itself? For to your conceptionsof three lines, you could not add anything new (that is, the figure);which, therefore, must necessarily be found in the object, because theobject is given before your cognition, and not by means of it. If,therefore, space (and time also) were not a mere form of yourintuition, which contains conditions à priori, under which alone thingscan become external objects for you, and without which subjectiveconditions the objects are in themselves nothing, you could notconstruct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding externalobjects. It is therefore not merely possible or probable, butindubitably certain, that space and time, as the necessary conditionsof all our external and internal experience, are merely subjectiveconditions of all our intuitions, in relation to which all objects aretherefore mere phenomena, and not things in themselves, presented to usin this particular manner. And for this reason, in respect to the formof phenomena, much may be said à priori, whilst of the thing in itself,which may lie at the foundation of these phenomena, it is impossible tosay anything.II. In confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external aswell as internal sense, consequently of all objects of sense, as merephenomena, we may especially remark that all in our cognition thatbelongs to intuition contains nothing more than mere relations. (Thefeelings of pain and pleasure, and the will, which are not cognitions,are excepted.) The relations, to wit, of place in an intuition(extension), change of place (motion), and laws according to which thischange is determined (moving forces). That, however, which is presentin this or that place, or any operation going on, or result takingplace in the things themselves, with the exception of change of place,is not given to us by intuition. Now by means of mere relations, athing cannot be known in itself; and it may therefore be fairlyconcluded, that, as through the external sense nothing but mererepresentations of relations are given us, the said external sense inits representation can contain only the relation of the object to thesubject, but not the essential nature of the object as a thing initself.The same is the case with the internal intuition, not only because, inthe internal intuition, the representation of the external sensesconstitutes the material with which the mind is occupied; but becausetime, in which we place, and which itself antecedes the consciousnessof, these representations in experience, and which, as the formalcondition of the mode according to which objects are placed in themind, lies at the foundation of them, contains relations of thesuccessive, the coexistent, and of that which always must be coexistentwith succession, the permanent. Now that which, as representation, canantecede every exercise of thought (of an object), is intuition; andwhen it contains nothing but relations, it is the form of theintuition, which, as it presents us with no representation, except inso far as something is placed in the mind, can be nothing else than themode in which the mind is affected by its own activity, to wit—itspresenting to itself representations, consequently the mode in whichthe mind is affected by itself; that is, it can be nothing but aninternal sense in respect to its form. Everything that is representedthrough the medium of sense is so far phenomenal; consequently, we musteither refuse altogether to admit an internal sense, or the subject,which is the object of that sense, could only be represented by it asphenomenon, and not as it would judge of itself, if its intuition werepure spontaneous activity, that is, were intellectual. The difficultyhere lies wholly in the question: How can the subject have an internalintuition of itself? But this difficulty is common to every theory. Theconsciousness of self (apperception) is the simple representation ofthe “ego”; and if by means of that representation alone, all themanifold representations in the subject were spontaneously given, thenour internal intuition would be intellectual. This consciousness in manrequires an internal perception of the manifold representations whichare previously given in the subject; and the manner in which theserepresentations are given in the mind without spontaneity, must, onaccount of this difference (the want of spontaneity), be calledsensibility. If the faculty of self-consciousness is to apprehend whatlies in the mind, it must all act that and can in this way aloneproduce an intuition of self. But the form of this intuition, whichlies in the original constitution of the mind, determines, in therepresentation of time, the manner in which the manifoldrepresentations are to combine themselves in the mind; since thesubject intuites itself, not as it would represent itself immediatelyand spontaneously, but according to the manner in which the mind isinternally affected, consequently, as it appears, and not as it is.III. When we say that the intuition of external objects, and also theself-intuition of the subject, represent both, objects and subject, inspace and time, as they affect our senses, that is, as they appear—thisis by no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mereillusory appearances. For when we speak of things as phenomena, theobjects, nay, even the properties which we ascribe to them, are lookedupon as really given; only that, in so far as this or that propertydepends upon the mode of intuition of the subject, in the relation ofthe given object to the subject, the object as phenomenon is to bedistinguished from the object as a thing in itself. Thus I do not saythat bodies seem or appear to be external to me, or that my soul seemsmerely to be given in my self-consciousness, although I maintain thatthe properties of space and time, in conformity to which I set both, asthe condition of their existence, abide in my mode of intuition, andnot in the objects in themselves. It would be my own fault, if out ofthat which I should reckon as phenomenon, I made mere illusoryappearance.[12] But this will not happen, because of our principle ofthe ideality of all sensuous intuitions. On the contrary, if we ascribeobjective reality to these forms of representation, it becomesimpossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance. For if weregard space and time as properties, which must be found in objects asthings in themselves, as sine quibus non of the possibility of theirexistence, and reflect on the absurdities in which we then findourselves involved, inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existenceof two infinite things, which are nevertheless not substances, noranything really inhering in substances, nay, to admit that they are thenecessary conditions of the existence of all things, and moreover, thatthey must continue to exist, although all existing things wereannihilated—we cannot blame the good Berkeley for degrading bodies tomere illusory appearances. Nay, even our own existence, which would inthis case depend upon the self-existent reality of such a merenonentity as time, would necessarily be changed with it into mereappearance—an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of. [12] The predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object itself in relation to our sensuous faculty; for example, the red colour or the perfume to the rose. But (illusory) appearance never can be attributed as a predicate to an object, for this very reason, that it attributes to this object in itself that which belongs to it only in relation to our sensuous faculty, or to the subject in general, e.g., the two handles which were formerly ascribed to Saturn. That which is never to be found in the object itself, but always in the relation of the object to the subject, and which moreover is inseparable from our representation of the object, we denominate phenomenon. Thus the predicates of space and time are rightly attributed to objects of the senses as such, and in this there is no illusion. On the contrary, if I ascribe redness of the rose as a thing in itself, or to Saturn his handles, or extension to all external objects, considered as things in themselves, without regarding the determinate relation of these objects to the subject, and without limiting my judgement to that relation—then, and then only, arises illusion.IV. In natural theology, where we think of an object—God—which nevercan be an object of intuition to us, and even to himself can never bean object of sensuous intuition, we carefully avoid attributing to hisintuition the conditions of space and time—and intuition all hiscognition must be, and not thought, which always includes limitation.But with what right can we do this if we make them forms of objects asthings in themselves, and such, moreover, as would continue to exist asà priori conditions of the existence of things, even though the thingsthemselves were annihilated? For as conditions of all existence ingeneral, space and time must be conditions of the existence of theSupreme Being also. But if we do not thus make them objective forms ofall things, there is no other way left than to make them subjectiveforms of our mode of intuition—external and internal; which is calledsensuous, because it is not primitive, that is, is not such as gives initself the existence of the object of the intuition (a mode ofintuition which, so far as we can judge, can belong only to theCreator), but is dependent on the existence of the object, is possible,therefore, only on condition that the representative faculty of thesubject is affected by the object.It is, moreover, not necessary that we should limit the mode ofintuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man. It may wellbe that all finite thinking beings must necessarily in this respectagree with man (though as to this we cannot decide), but sensibilitydoes not on account of this universality cease to be sensibility, forthis very reason, that it is a deduced (intuitus derivativus), and notan original (intuitus originarius), consequently not an intellectualintuition, and this intuition, as such, for reasons above mentioned,seems to belong solely to the Supreme Being, but never to a beingdependent, quoad its existence, as well as its intuition (which itsexistence determines and limits relatively to given objects). Thislatter remark, however, must be taken only as an illustration, and notas any proof of the truth of our æsthetical theory.§ 10. Conclusion of the Transcendental Æsthetic.We have now completely before us one part of the solution of the grandgeneral problem of transcendental philosophy, namely, the question:“How are synthetical propositions à priori possible?” That is to say,we have shown that we are in possession of pure à priori intuitions,namely, space and time, in which we find, when in a judgement à prioriwe pass out beyond the given conception, something which is notdiscoverable in that conception, but is certainly found à priori in theintuition which corresponds to the conception, and can be unitedsynthetically with it. But the judgements which these pure intuitionsenable us to make, never reach farther than to objects of the senses,and are valid only for objects of possible experience.Second Part—TRANSCENDENTAL LOGICINTRODUCTION. Idea of a Transcendental Logic.I. Of Logic in General.Our knowledge springs from two main sources in the mind, first of whichis the faculty or power of receiving representations (receptivity forimpressions); the second is the power of cognizing by means of theserepresentations (spontaneity in the production of conceptions). Throughthe first an object is given to us; through the second, it is, inrelation to the representation (which is a mere determination of themind), thought. Intuition and conceptions constitute, therefore, theelements of all our knowledge, so that neither conceptions without anintuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition withoutconceptions, can afford us a cognition. Both are either pure orempirical. They are empirical, when sensation (which presupposes theactual presence of the object) is contained in them; and pure, when nosensation is mixed with the representation. Sensations we may call thematter of sensuous cognition. Pure intuition consequently containsmerely the form under which something is intuited, and pure conceptiononly the form of the thought of an object. Only pure intuitions andpure conceptions are possible à priori; the empirical only àposteriori.We apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind forimpressions, in so far as it is in some way affected; and, on the otherhand, we call the faculty of spontaneously producing representations,or the spontaneity of cognition, understanding. Our nature is soconstituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous,that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects.On the other hand, the faculty of thinking the object of sensuousintuition is the understanding. Neither of these faculties has apreference over the other. Without the sensuous faculty no object wouldbe given to us, and without the understanding no object would bethought. Thoughts without content are void; intuitions withoutconceptions, blind. Hence it is as necessary for the mind to make itsconceptions sensuous (that is, to join to them the object inintuition), as to make its intuitions intelligible (that is, to bringthem under conceptions). Neither of these faculties can exchange itsproper function. Understanding cannot intuite, and the sensuous facultycannot think. In no other way than from the united operation of both,can knowledge arise. But no one ought, on this account, to overlook thedifference of the elements contributed by each; we have rather greatreason carefully to separate and distinguish them. We thereforedistinguish the science of the laws of sensibility, that is, æsthetic,from the science of the laws of the understanding, that is, logic.Now, logic in its turn may be considered as twofold—namely, as logic ofthe general, or of the particular use of the understanding. The firstcontains the absolutely necessary laws of thought, without which no usewhatsoever of the understanding is possible, and gives laws thereforeto the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects onwhich it may be employed. The logic of the particular use of theunderstanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particularclass of objects. The former may be called elemental logic—the latter,the organon of this or that particular science. The latter is for themost part employed in the schools, as a propædeutic to the sciences,although, indeed, according to the course of human reason, it is thelast thing we arrive at, when the science has been already matured, andneeds only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion;for our knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must betolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the laws bywhich a science of these objects can be established.General logic is again either pure or applied. In the former, weabstract all the empirical conditions under which the understanding isexercised; for example, the influence of the senses, the play of thefantasy or imagination, the laws of the memory, the force of habit, ofinclination, etc., consequently also, the sources of prejudice—in aword, we abstract all causes from which particular cognitions arise,because these causes regard the understanding under certaincircumstances of its application, and, to the knowledge of themexperience is required. Pure general logic has to do, therefore, merelywith pure à priori principles, and is a canon of understanding andreason, but only in respect of the formal part of their use, be thecontent what it may, empirical or transcendental. General logic iscalled applied, when it is directed to the laws of the use of theunderstanding, under the subjective empirical conditions whichpsychology teaches us. It has therefore empirical principles, although,at the same time, it is in so far general, that it applies to theexercise of the understanding, without regard to the difference ofobjects. On this account, moreover, it is neither a canon of theunderstanding in general, nor an organon of a particular science, butmerely a cathartic of the human understanding.In general logic, therefore, that part which constitutes pure logicmust be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied(though still general) logic. The former alone is properly science,although short and dry, as the methodical exposition of an elementaldoctrine of the understanding ought to be. In this, therefore,logicians must always bear in mind two rules:1. As general logic, it makes abstraction of all content of thecognition of the understanding, and of the difference of objects, andhas to do with nothing but the mere form of thought.2. As pure logic, it has no empirical principles, and consequentlydraws nothing (contrary to the common persuasion) from psychology,which therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding. Itis a demonstrated doctrine, and everything in it must be certaincompletely à priori.What I called applied logic (contrary to the common acceptation of thisterm, according to which it should contain certain exercises for thescholar, for which pure logic gives the rules), is a representation ofthe understanding, and of the rules of its necessary employment inconcreto, that is to say, under the accidental conditions of thesubject, which may either hinder or promote this employment, and whichare all given only empirically. Thus applied logic treats of attention,its impediments and consequences, of the origin of error, of the stateof doubt, hesitation, conviction, etc., and to it is related puregeneral logic in the same way that pure morality, which contains onlythe necessary moral laws of a free will, is related to practicalethics, which considers these laws under all the impediments offeelings, inclinations, and passions to which men are more or lesssubjected, and which never can furnish us with a true and demonstratedscience, because it, as well as applied logic, requires empirical andpsychological principles.II. Of Transcendental Logic.General logic, as we have seen, makes abstraction of all content ofcognition, that is, of all relation of cognition to its object, andregards only the logical form in the relation of cognitions to eachother, that is, the form of thought in general. But as we have bothpure and empirical intuitions (as transcendental æsthetic proves), inlike manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empiricalthought (of objects). In this case, there would exist a kind of logic,in which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition;for or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure thought (ofan object), would of course exclude all those cognitions which were ofempirical content. This kind of logic would also examine the origin ofour cognitions of objects, so far as that origin cannot be ascribed tothe objects themselves; while, on the contrary, general logic hasnothing to do with the origin of our cognitions, but contemplates ourrepresentations, be they given primitively à priori in ourselves, or bethey only of empirical origin, solely according to the laws which theunderstanding observes in employing them in the process of thought, inrelation to each other. Consequently, general logic treats of the formof the understanding only, which can be applied to representations,from whatever source they may have arisen.And here I shall make a remark, which the reader must bear well in mindin the course of the following considerations, to wit, that not everycognition à priori, but only those through which we cognize that andhow certain representations (intuitions or conceptions) are applied orare possible only à priori; that is to say, the à priori possibility ofcognition and the à priori use of it are transcendental. Thereforeneither is space, nor any à priori geometrical determination of space,a transcendental Representation, but only the knowledge that such arepresentation is not of empirical origin, and the possibility of itsrelating to objects of experience, although itself à priori, can becalled transcendental. So also, the application of space to objects ingeneral would be transcendental; but if it be limited to objects ofsense it is empirical. Thus, the distinction of the transcendental andempirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions, and does notconcern the relation of these to their object.Accordingly, in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptionswhich relate à priori to objects, not as pure or sensuous intuitions,but merely as acts of pure thought (which are therefore conceptions,but neither of empirical nor æsthetical origin)—in this expectation, Isay, we form to ourselves, by anticipation, the idea of a science ofpure understanding and rational cognition, by means of which we maycogitate objects entirely à priori. A science of this kind, whichshould determine the origin, the extent, and the objective validity ofsuch cognitions, must be called transcendental logic, because it hasnot, like general logic, to do with the laws of understanding andreason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitionswithout distinction, but concerns itself with these only in an à priorirelation to objects.III. Of the Division of General Logic into Analytic and Dialectic.The old question with which people sought to push logicians into acorner, so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms orconfess their ignorance, and consequently the vanity of their wholeart, is this: “What is truth?” The definition of the word truth, towit, “the accordance of the cognition with its object,” is presupposedin the question; but we desire to be told, in the answer to it, what isthe universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition.To know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strongevidence of sagacity and intelligence. For if a question be in itselfabsurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer, it is attended with thedanger—not to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposesit—of seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers, andwe are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one (as the ancientssaid) “milking the he-goat, and the other holding a sieve.”If truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object,this object must be, ipso facto, distinguished from all others; for acognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which itrelates, although it contains something which may be affirmed of otherobjects. Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which isvalid for all cognitions, without distinction of their objects. But itis evident that since, in the case of such a criterion, we makeabstraction of all the content of a cognition (that is, of all relationto its object), and truth relates precisely to this content, it must beutterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content ofcognition; and that, accordingly, a sufficient, and at the same timeuniversal, test of truth cannot possibly be found. As we have alreadytermed the content of a cognition its matter, we shall say: “Of thetruth of our cognitions in respect of their matter, no universal testcan be demanded, because such a demand is self-contradictory.”On the other hand, with regard to our cognition in respect of its mereform (excluding all content), it is equally manifest that logic, in sofar as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of theunderstanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria oftruth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby theunderstanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;that is, to contradict itself. These criteria, however, apply solely tothe form of truth, that is, of thought in general, and in so far theyare perfectly accurate, yet not sufficient. For although a cognitionmay be perfectly accurate as to logical form, that is, notself-contradictory, it is notwithstanding quite possible that it maynot stand in agreement with its object. Consequently, the merelylogical criterion of truth, namely, the accordance of a cognition withthe universal and formal laws of understanding and reason, is nothingmore than the conditio sine qua non, or negative condition of alltruth. Farther than this logic cannot go, and the error which dependsnot on the form, but on the content of the cognition, it has no test todiscover.General logic, then, resolves the whole formal business ofunderstanding and reason into its elements, and exhibits them asprinciples of all logical judging of our cognitions. This part of logicmay, therefore, be called analytic, and is at least the negative testof truth, because all cognitions must first of an be estimated andtried according to these laws before we proceed to investigate them inrespect of their content, in order to discover whether they containpositive truth in regard to their object. Because, however, the mereform of a cognition, accurately as it may accord with logical laws, isinsufficient to supply us with material (objective) truth, no one, bymeans of logic alone, can venture to predicate anything of or decideconcerning objects, unless he has obtained, independently of logic,well-grounded information about them, in order afterwards to examine,according to logical laws, into the use and connection, in a coheringwhole, of that information, or, what is still better, merely to test itby them. Notwithstanding, there lies so seductive a charm in thepossession of a specious art like this—an art which gives to all ourcognitions the form of the understanding, although with respect to thecontent thereof we may be sadly deficient—that general logic, which ismerely a canon of judgement, has been employed as an organon for theactual production, or rather for the semblance of production, ofobjective assertions, and has thus been grossly misapplied. Now generallogic, in its assumed character of organon, is called dialectic.Different as are the significations in which the ancients used thisterm for a science or an art, we may safely infer, from their actualemployment of it, that with them it was nothing else than a logic ofillusion—a sophistical art for giving ignorance, nay, even intentionalsophistries, the colouring of truth, in which the thoroughness ofprocedure which logic requires was imitated, and their topic employedto cloak the empty pretensions. Now it may be taken as a safe anduseful warning, that general logic, considered as an organon, mustalways be a logic of illusion, that is, be dialectical, for, as itteaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions,but merely the formal conditions of their accordance with theunderstanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent inrespect of objects, any attempt to employ it as an instrument (organon)in order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end inmere prating; any one being able to maintain or oppose, with someappearance of truth, any single assertion whatever.Such instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy. Forthese reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logicdialectic, in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion, and wewish the term to be so understood in this place.IV. Of the Division of Transcendental Logic into TranscendentalAnalytic and Dialectic.In transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as intranscendental æsthetic the sensibility) and select from our cognitionmerely that part of thought which has its origin in the understandingalone. The exercise of this pure cognition, however, depends upon thisas its condition, that objects to which it may be applied be given tous in intuition, for without intuition the whole of our cognition iswithout objects, and is therefore quite void. That part oftranscendental logic, then, which treats of the elements of purecognition of the understanding, and of the principles without which noobject at all can be thought, is transcendental analytic, and at thesame time a logic of truth. For no cognition can contradict it, withoutlosing at the same time all content, that is, losing all reference toan object, and therefore all truth. But because we are very easilyseduced into employing these pure cognitions and principles of theunderstanding by themselves, and that even beyond the boundaries ofexperience, which yet is the only source whence we can obtain matter(objects) on which those pure conceptions may be employed—understandingruns the risk of making, by means of empty sophisms, a material andobjective use of the mere formal principles of the pure understanding,and of passing judgements on objects without distinction—objects whichare not given to us, nay, perhaps cannot be given to us in any way.Now, as it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of theempirical use of the understanding, this kind of logic is misused whenwe seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimitedexercise of the understanding, and attempt with the pure understandingalone to judge synthetically, affirm, and determine respecting objectsin general. In this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomesdialectical. The second part of our transcendental logic must thereforebe a critique of dialectical illusion, and this critique we shall termtranscendental dialectic—not meaning it as an art of producingdogmatically such illusion (an art which is unfortunately too currentamong the practitioners of metaphysical juggling), but as a critique ofunderstanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use. Thiscritique will expose the groundless nature of the pretensions of thesetwo faculties, and invalidate their claims to the discovery andenlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendentalprinciples, and show that the proper employment of these faculties isto test the judgements made by the pure understanding, and to guard itfrom sophistical delusion.FIRST DIVISION. TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC. TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYTIC. § 1Transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our à prioriknowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding.In order to effect our purpose, it is necessary: (1) That theconceptions be pure and not empirical; (2) That they belong not tointuition and sensibility, but to thought and understanding; (3) Thatthey be elementary conceptions, and as such, quite different fromdeduced or compound conceptions; (4) That our table of these elementaryconceptions be complete, and fill up the whole sphere of the pureunderstanding. Now this completeness of a science cannot be acceptedwith confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence inan aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts.The completeness which we require is possible only by means of an ideaof the totality of the à priori cognition of the understanding, andthrough the thereby determined division of the conceptions which formthe said whole; consequently, only by means of their connection in asystem. Pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely fromeverything empirical, but also completely from all sensibility. It is aunity self-subsistent, self-sufficient, and not to be enlarged by anyadditions from without. Hence the sum of its cognition constitutes asystem to be determined by and comprised under an idea; and thecompleteness and articulation of this system can at the same time serveas a test of the correctness and genuineness of all the parts ofcognition that belong to it. The whole of this part of transcendentallogic consists of two books, of which the one contains the conceptions,and the other the principles of pure understanding.BOOK I. Analytic of Conceptions. § 2By the term Analytic of Conceptions, I do not understand the analysisof these, or the usual process in philosophical investigations ofdissecting the conceptions which present themselves, according to theircontent, and so making them clear; but I mean the hitherto littleattempted dissection of the faculty of understanding itself, in orderto investigate the possibility of conceptions à priori, by looking forthem in the understanding alone, as their birthplace, and analysing thepure use of this faculty. For this is the proper duty of atranscendental philosophy; what remains is the logical treatment of theconceptions in philosophy in general. We shall therefore follow up thepure conceptions even to their germs and beginnings in the humanunderstanding, in which they lie, until they are developed on occasionspresented by experience, and, freed by the same understanding from theempirical conditions attaching to them, are set forth in theirunalloyed purity.Chapter I. Of the Transcendental Clue to the Discovery of all Pure Conceptions of the UnderstandingIntroductory § 3When we call into play a faculty of cognition, different conceptionsmanifest themselves according to the different circumstances, and makeknown this faculty, and assemble themselves into a more or lessextensive collection, according to the time or penetration that hasbeen applied to the consideration of them. Where this process,conducted as it is mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot bedetermined with certainty. Besides, the conceptions which we discoverin this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order andsystematic unity, but are at last coupled together only according toresemblances to each other, and arranged in series, according to thequantity of their content, from the simpler to the more complex—serieswhich are anything but systematic, though not altogether without acertain kind of method in their construction.Transcendental philosophy has the advantage, and moreover the duty, ofsearching for its conceptions according to a principle; because theseconceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as anabsolute unity, and therefore must be connected with each otheraccording to one conception or idea. A connection of this kind,however, furnishes us with a ready prepared rule, by which its properplace may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding,and the completeness of the system of all be determined à priori—bothwhich would otherwise have been dependent on mere choice or chance.Section I. Of the Logical Use of the Understanding in General § 4The understanding was defined above only negatively, as a non-sensuousfaculty of cognition. Now, independently of sensibility, we cannotpossibly have any intuition; consequently, the understanding is nofaculty of intuition. But besides intuition there is no other mode ofcognition, except through conceptions; consequently, the cognition ofevery, at least of every human, understanding is a cognition throughconceptions—not intuitive, but discursive. All intuitions, as sensuous,depend on affections; conceptions, therefore, upon functions. By theword function I understand the unity of the act of arranging diverserepresentations under one common representation. Conceptions, then, arebased on the spontaneity of thought, as sensuous intuitions are on thereceptivity of impressions. Now, the understanding cannot make anyother use of these conceptions than to judge by means of them. As norepresentation, except an intuition, relates immediately to its object,a conception never relates immediately to an object, but only to someother representation thereof, be that an intuition or itself aconception. A judgement, therefore, is the mediate cognition of anobject, consequently the representation of a representation of it. Inevery judgement there is a conception which applies to, and is validfor many other conceptions, and which among these comprehends also agiven representation, this last being immediately connected with anobject. For example, in the judgement—“All bodies are divisible,” ourconception of divisible applies to various other conceptions; amongthese, however, it is here particularly applied to the conception ofbody, and this conception of body relates to certain phenomena whichoccur to us. These objects, therefore, are mediately represented by theconception of divisibility. All judgements, accordingly, are functionsof unity in our representations, inasmuch as, instead of an immediate,a higher representation, which comprises this and various others, isused for our cognition of the object, and thereby many possiblecognitions are collected into one. But we can reduce all acts of theunderstanding to judgements, so that understanding may be representedas the faculty of judging. For it is, according to what has been saidabove, a faculty of thought. Now thought is cognition by means ofconceptions. But conceptions, as predicates of possible judgements,relate to some representation of a yet undetermined object. Thus theconception of body indicates something—for example, metal—which can becognized by means of that conception. It is therefore a conception, forthe reason alone that other representations are contained under it, bymeans of which it can relate to objects. It is therefore the predicateto a possible judgement; for example: “Every metal is a body.” All thefunctions of the understanding therefore can be discovered, when we cancompletely exhibit the functions of unity in judgements. And that thismay be effected very easily, the following section will show.Section II. Of the Logical Function of the Understanding in Judgements§ 5If we abstract all the content of a judgement, and consider only theintellectual form thereof, we find that the function of thought in ajudgement can be brought under four heads, of which each contains threemomenta. These may be conveniently represented in the following table:                                    1                         _Quantity of judgements_                                Universal                                Particular                                Singular                      2                           3                    _Quality                   Relation_                  Affirmative                Categorical                  Negative                   Hypothetical                  Infinite                   Disjunctive                                    4                                 _Modality_                               Problematical                               Assertorical                               ApodeicticalAs this division appears to differ in some, though not essentialpoints, from the usual technique of logicians, the followingobservations, for the prevention of otherwise possiblemisunderstanding, will not be without their use.1. Logicians say, with justice, that in the use of judgements insyllogisms, singular judgements may be treated like universal ones.For, precisely because a singular judgement has no extent at all, itspredicate cannot refer to a part of that which is contained in theconception of the subject and be excluded from the rest. The predicateis valid for the whole conception just as if it were a generalconception, and had extent, to the whole of which the predicateapplied. On the other hand, let us compare a singular with a generaljudgement, merely as a cognition, in regard to quantity. The singularjudgement relates to the general one, as unity to infinity, and istherefore in itself essentially different. Thus, if we estimate asingular judgement (_judicium singulare_) not merely according to itsintrinsic validity as a judgement, but also as a cognition generally,according to its quantity in comparison with that of other cognitions,it is then entirely different from a general judgement (_judiciumcommune_), and in a complete table of the momenta of thought deserves aseparate place—though, indeed, this would not be necessary in a logiclimited merely to the consideration of the use of judgements inreference to each other.2. In like manner, in transcendental logic, infinite must bedistinguished from affirmative judgements, although in general logicthey are rightly enough classed under affirmative. General logicabstracts all content of the predicate (though it be negative), andonly considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of thesubject. But transcendental logic considers also the worth or contentof this logical affirmation—an affirmation by means of a merelynegative predicate, and inquires how much the sum total of ourcognition gains by this affirmation. For example, if I say of the soul,“It is not mortal”—by this negative judgement I should at least wardoff error. Now, by the proposition, “The soul is not mortal,” I have,in respect of the logical form, really affirmed, inasmuch as I therebyplace the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings. Now, becauseof the whole sphere of possible existences, the mortal occupies onepart, and the immortal the other, neither more nor less is affirmed bythe proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitudeof things which remain over, when I take away the whole mortal part.But by this proceeding we accomplish only this much, that the infinitesphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortalis excluded from it, and the soul is placed in the remaining part ofthe extent of this sphere. But this part remains, notwithstanding thisexception, infinite, and more and more parts may be taken away from thewhole sphere, without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting oraffirmatively determining our conception of the soul. These judgements,therefore, infinite in respect of their logical extent, are, in respectof the content of their cognition, merely limitative; and areconsequently entitled to a place in our transcendental table of all themomenta of thought in judgements, because the function of theunderstanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in thefield of its pure à priori cognition.3. All relations of thought in judgements are those (a) of thepredicate to the subject; (b) of the principle to its consequence; (c)of the divided cognition and all the members of the division to eachother. In the first of these three classes, we consider only twoconceptions; in the second, two judgements; in the third, severaljudgements in relation to each other. The hypothetical proposition, “Ifperfect justice exists, the obstinately wicked are punished,” containsproperly the relation to each other of two propositions, namely,“Perfect justice exists,” and “The obstinately wicked are punished.”Whether these propositions are in themselves true is a question nothere decided. Nothing is cogitated by means of this judgement except acertain consequence. Finally, the disjunctive judgement contains arelation of two or more propositions to each other—a relation not ofconsequence, but of logical opposition, in so far as the sphere of theone proposition excludes that of the other. But it contains at the sametime a relation of community, in so far as all the propositions takentogether fill up the sphere of the cognition. The disjunctive judgementcontains, therefore, the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of acognition, since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of thesphere of the other, each contributing to form the sum total of thedivided cognition. Take, for example, the proposition, “The worldexists either through blind chance, or through internal necessity, orthrough an external cause.” Each of these propositions embraces a partof the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world;all of them taken together, the whole sphere. To take the cognition outof one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of theothers; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalentto taking it out of the rest. There is, therefore, in a disjunctivejudgement a certain community of cognitions, which consists in this,that they mutually exclude each other, yet thereby determine, as awhole, the true cognition, inasmuch as, taken together, they make upthe complete content of a particular given cognition. And this is allthat I find necessary, for the sake of what follows, to remark in thisplace.4. The modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function, with thisdistinguishing characteristic, that it contributes nothing to thecontent of a judgement (for besides quantity, quality, and relation,there is nothing more that constitutes the content of a judgement), butconcerns itself only with the value of the copula in relation tothought in general. Problematical judgements are those in which theaffirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible (ad libitum). Inthe assertorical, we regard the proposition as real (true); in theapodeictical, we look on it as necessary.[13] Thus the two judgements(antecedens et consequens), the relation of which constitutes ahypothetical judgement, likewise those (the members of the division) inwhose reciprocity the disjunctive consists, are only problematical. Inthe example above given the proposition, “There exists perfectjustice,” is not stated assertorically, but as an ad libitum judgement,which someone may choose to adopt, and the consequence alone isassertorical. Hence such judgements may be obviously false, and yet,taken problematically, be conditions of our cognition of the truth.Thus the proposition, “The world exists only by blind chance,” is inthe disjunctive judgement of problematical import only: that is to say,one may accept it for the moment, and it helps us (like the indicationof the wrong road among all the roads that one can take) to find outthe true proposition. The problematical proposition is, therefore, thatwhich expresses only logical possibility (which is not objective); thatis, it expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such aproposition—a merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding.The assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth; as, for example,in a hypothetical syllogism, the antecedens presents itself in aproblematical form in the major, in an assertorical form in the minor,and it shows that the proposition is in harmony with the laws of theunderstanding. The apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertoricalas determined by these very laws of the understanding, consequently asaffirming à priori, and in this manner it expresses logical necessity.Now because all is here gradually incorporated with theunderstanding—inasmuch as in the first place we judge problematically;then accept assertorically our judgement as true; lastly, affirm it asinseparably united with the understanding, that is, as necessary andapodeictical—we may safely reckon these three functions of modality asso many momenta of thought. [13] Just as if thought were in the first instance a function of the understanding; in the second, of judgement; in the third, of reason. A remark which will be explained in the sequel.Section III. Of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding, orCategories § 6General logic, as has been repeatedly said, makes abstraction of allcontent of cognition, and expects to receive representations from someother quarter, in order, by means of analysis, to convert them intoconceptions. On the contrary, transcendental logic has lying before itthe manifold content of à priori sensibility, which transcendentalæsthetic presents to it in order to give matter to the pure conceptionsof the understanding, without which transcendental logic would have nocontent, and be therefore utterly void. Now space and time contain aninfinite diversity of determinations of pure à priori intuition, butare nevertheless the condition of the mind’s receptivity, under whichalone it can obtain representations of objects, and which,consequently, must always affect the conception of these objects. Butthe spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examinedafter a certain manner, received into the mind, and connected, in orderafterwards to form a cognition out of it. This Process I callsynthesis.By the word synthesis, in its most general signification, I understandthe process of joining different representations to each other and ofcomprehending their diversity in one cognition. This synthesis is purewhen the diversity is not given empirically but à priori (as that inspace and time). Our representations must be given previously to anyanalysis of them; and no conceptions can arise, quoad their content,analytically. But the synthesis of a diversity (be it given à priori orempirically) is the first requisite for the production of a cognition,which in its beginning, indeed, may be crude and confused, andtherefore in need of analysis—still, synthesis is that by which alonethe elements of our cognitions are collected and united into a certaincontent, consequently it is the first thing on which we must fix ourattention, if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge.Synthesis, generally speaking, is, as we shall afterwards see, the mereoperation of the imagination—a blind but indispensable function of thesoul, without which we should have no cognition whatever, but of theworking of which we are seldom even conscious. But to reduce thissynthesis to conceptions is a function of the understanding, by meansof which we attain to cognition, in the proper meaning of the term.Pure synthesis, represented generally, gives us the pure conception ofthe understanding. But by this pure synthesis, I mean that which restsupon a basis of à priori synthetical unity. Thus, our numeration (andthis is more observable in large numbers) is a synthesis according toconceptions, because it takes place according to a common basis ofunity (for example, the decade). By means of this conception,therefore, the unity in the synthesis of the manifold becomesnecessary.By means of analysis different representations are brought under oneconception—an operation of which general logic treats. On the otherhand, the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions, notrepresentations, but the pure synthesis of representations. The firstthing which must be given to us for the sake of the à priori cognitionof all objects, is the diversity of the pure intuition; the synthesisof this diversity by means of the imagination is the second; but thisgives, as yet, no cognition. The conceptions which give unity to thispure synthesis, and which consist solely in the representation of thisnecessary synthetical unity, furnish the third requisite for thecognition of an object, and these conceptions are given by theunderstanding.The same function which gives unity to the different representation ina judgement, gives also unity to the mere synthesis of differentrepresentations in an intuition; and this unity we call the pureconception of the understanding. Thus, the same understanding, and bythe same operations, whereby in conceptions, by means of analyticalunity, it produced the logical form of a judgement, introduces, bymeans of the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition, atranscendental content into its representations, on which account theyare called pure conceptions of the understanding, and they apply àpriori to objects, a result not within the power of general logic.In this manner, there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of theunderstanding, applying à priori to objects of intuition in general, asthere are logical functions in all possible judgements. For there is noother function or faculty existing in the understanding besides thoseenumerated in that table. These conceptions we shall, with Aristotle,call categories, our purpose being originally identical with his,notwithstanding the great difference in the execution.                     TABLE OF THE CATEGORIES                    1                         2              _Of Quantity                Of Quality_              Unity                      Reality              Plurality                  Negation              Totality                   Limitation                           3                      _Of Relation_   Of Inherence and Subsistence (substantia et accidens)   Of Causality and Dependence (cause and effect)   Of Community (reciprocity between the agent and patient)                           4                     _Of Modality_              Possibility&mdash;Impossibility              Existence&mdash;Non-existence              Necessity&mdash;ContingenceThis, then, is a catalogue of all the originally pure conceptions ofthe synthesis which the understanding contains à priori, and theseconceptions alone entitle it to be called a pure understanding;inasmuch as only by them it can render the manifold of intuitionconceivable, in other words, think an object of intuition. Thisdivision is made systematically from a common principle, namely thefaculty of judgement (which is just the same as the power of thought),and has not arisen rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after pureconceptions, respecting the full number of which we never could becertain, inasmuch as we employ induction alone in our search, withoutconsidering that in this way we can never understand whereforeprecisely these conceptions, and none others, abide in the pureunderstanding. It was a design worthy of an acute thinker likeAristotle, to search for these fundamental conceptions. Destitute,however, of any guiding principle, he picked them up just as theyoccurred to him, and at first hunted out ten, which he calledcategories (predicaments). Afterwards be believed that he haddiscovered five others, which were added under the name of postpredicaments. But his catalogue still remained defective. Besides,there are to be found among them some of the modes of pure sensibility(quando, ubi, situs, also prius, simul), and likewise an empiricalconception (motus)—which can by no means belong to this genealogicalregister of the pure understanding. Moreover, there are deducedconceptions (actio, passio) enumerated among the original conceptions,and, of the latter, some are entirely wanting.With regard to these, it is to be remarked, that the categories, as thetrue primitive conceptions of the pure understanding, have also theirpure deduced conceptions, which, in a complete system of transcendentalphilosophy, must by no means be passed over; though in a merelycritical essay we must be contented with the simple mention of thefact.Let it be allowed me to call these pure, but deduced conceptions of theunderstanding, the predicables of the pure understanding, incontradistinction to predicaments. If we are in possession of theoriginal and primitive, the deduced and subsidiary conceptions caneasily be added, and the genealogical tree of the understandingcompletely delineated. As my present aim is not to set forth a completesystem, but merely the principles of one, I reserve this task foranother time. It may be easily executed by any one who will refer tothe ontological manuals, and subordinate to the category of causality,for example, the predicables of force, action, passion; to that ofcommunity, those of presence and resistance; to the categories ofmodality, those of origination, extinction, change; and so with therest. The categories combined with the modes of pure sensibility, orwith one another, afford a great number of deduced à prioriconceptions; a complete enumeration of which would be a useful and notunpleasant, but in this place a perfectly dispensable, occupation.I purposely omit the definitions of the categories in this treatise. Ishall analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for thedoctrine of method, which is to form a part of this critique. In asystem of pure reason, definitions of them would be with justicedemanded of me, but to give them here would only bide from our view themain aim of our investigation, at the same time raising doubts andobjections, the consideration of which, without injustice to our mainpurpose, may be very well postponed till another opportunity.Meanwhile, it ought to be sufficiently clear, from the little we havealready said on this subject, that the formation of a completevocabulary of pure conceptions, accompanied by all the requisiteexplanations, is not only a possible, but an easy undertaking. Thecompartments already exist; it is only necessary to fill them up; and asystematic topic like the present, indicates with perfect precision theproper place to which each conception belongs, while it readily pointsout any that have not yet been filled up.§ 7Our table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance,which may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientificform of all rational cognitions. For, that this table is useful in thetheoretical part of philosophy, nay, indispensable for the sketching ofthe complete plan of a science, so far as that science rests uponconceptions à priori, and for dividing it mathematically, according tofixed principles, is most manifest from the fact that it contains allthe elementary conceptions of the understanding, nay, even the form ofa system of these in the understanding itself, and consequentlyindicates all the momenta, and also the internal arrangement of aprojected speculative science, as I have elsewhere shown.[14] Herefollow some of these observations. [14] In the “Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science.”I. This table, which contains four classes of conceptions of theunderstanding, may, in the first instance, be divided into two classes,the first of which relates to objects of intuition—pure as well asempirical; the second, to the existence of these objects, either inrelation to one another, or to the understanding.The former of these classes of categories I would entitle themathematical, and the latter the dynamical categories. The former, aswe see, has no correlates; these are only to be found in the secondclass. This difference must have a ground in the nature of the humanunderstanding.II. The number of the categories in each class is always the same,namely, three—a fact which also demands some consideration, because inall other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarilydichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triadalways arises from the combination of the second with the first.Thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity;limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is thecausality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined byother substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence,which is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed,however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not aprimitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction ofthe first and second, in order to produce the third conception,requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by nomeans identical with those which are exercised in the first and second.Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category oftotality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitudeand unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite).Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, itdoes not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how onesubstance can be the cause of something in another substance, will beunderstood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of theunderstanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.III. With respect to one category, namely, that of community, which isfound in the third class, it is not so easy as with the others todetect its accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement whichcorresponds to it in the table of the logical functions.In order to assure ourselves of this accordance, we must observe thatin every disjunctive judgement, the sphere of the judgement (that is,the complex of all that is contained in it) is represented as a wholedivided into parts; and, since one part cannot be contained in theother, they are cogitated as co-ordinated with, not subordinated toeach other, so that they do not determine each other unilaterally, asin a linear series, but reciprocally, as in an aggregate—(if one memberof the division is posited, all the rest are excluded; and conversely).Now a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things; for one thingis not subordinated, as effect, to another as cause of its existence,but, on the contrary, is co-ordinated contemporaneously andreciprocally, as a cause in relation to the determination of the others(for example, in a body—the parts of which mutually attract and repeleach other). And this is an entirely different kind of connection fromthat which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect (theprinciple to the consequence), for in such a connection the consequencedoes not in its turn determine the principle, and therefore does notconstitute, with the latter, a whole—just as the Creator does not withthe world make up a whole. The process of understanding by which itrepresents to itself the sphere of a divided conception, is employedalso when we think of a thing as divisible; and in the same manner asthe members of the division in the former exclude one another, and yetare connected in one sphere, so the understanding represents to itselfthe parts of the latter, as having—each of them—an existence (assubstances), independently of the others, and yet as united in onewhole.§ 8In the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one moreleading division, which contains pure conceptions of the understanding,and which, although not numbered among the categories, ought, accordingto them, as conceptions à priori, to be valid of objects. But in thiscase they would augment the number of the categories; which cannot be.These are set forth in the proposition, so renowned among theschoolmen—‘_Quodlibet ens est UNUM, VERUM, BONUM_.’ Now, though theinferences from this principle were mere tautological propositions, andthough it is allowed only by courtesy to retain a place in modernmetaphysics, yet a thought which maintained itself for such a length oftime, however empty it seems to be, deserves an investigation of itsorigin, and justifies the conjecture that it must be grounded in somelaw of the understanding, which, as is often the case, has only beenerroneously interpreted. These pretended transcendental predicates are,in fact, nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all cognitionof objects, and they employ, as the basis for this cognition, thecategories of quantity, namely, unity, plurality, and totality. Butthese, which must be taken as material conditions, that is, asbelonging to the possibility of things themselves, they employed merelyin a formal signification, as belonging to the logical requisites ofall cognition, and yet most unguardedly changed these criteria ofthought into properties of objects, as things in themselves. Now, inevery cognition of an object, there is unity of conception, which maybe called qualitative unity, so far as by this term we understand onlythe unity in our connection of the manifold; for example, unity of thetheme in a play, an oration, or a story. Secondly, there is truth inrespect of the deductions from it. The more true deductions we havefrom a given conception, the more criteria of its objective reality.This we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks,which belong to a conception as to a common foundation, but are notcogitated as a quantity in it. Thirdly, there is perfection—whichconsists in this, that the plurality falls back upon the unity of theconception, and accords completely with that conception and with noother. This we may denominate qualitative completeness. Hence it isevident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition aremerely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed tosuit an unauthorized manner of applying them. That is to say, the threecategories, in which the unity in the production of the quantum must behomogeneous throughout, are transformed solely with a view to theconnection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act ofconsciousness, by means of the quality of the cognition, which is theprinciple of that connection. Thus the criterion of the possibility ofa conception (not of its object) is the definition of it, in which theunity of the conception, the truth of all that may be immediatelydeduced from it, and finally, the completeness of what has been thusdeduced, constitute the requisites for the reproduction of the wholeconception. Thus also, the criterion or test of an hypothesis is theintelligibility of the received principle of explanation, or its unity(without help from any subsidiary hypothesis)—the truth of ourdeductions from it (consistency with each other and withexperience)—and lastly, the completeness of the principle of theexplanation of these deductions, which refer to neither more nor lessthan what was admitted in the hypothesis, restoring analytically and àposteriori, what was cogitated synthetically and à priori. By theconceptions, therefore, of unity, truth, and perfection, we have madeno addition to the transcendental table of the categories, which iscomplete without them. We have, on the contrary, merely employed thethree categories of quantity, setting aside their application toobjects of experience, as general logical laws of the consistency ofcognition with itself.Chapter II. Of the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of theUnderstandingSection I. Of the Principles of a Transcendental Deduction in general §9Teachers of jurisprudence, when speaking of rights and claims,distinguish in a cause the question of right (quid juris) from thequestion of fact (quid facti), and while they demand proof of both,they give to the proof of the former, which goes to establish right orclaim in law, the name of deduction. Now we make use of a great numberof empirical conceptions, without opposition from any one; and considerourselves, even without any attempt at deduction, justified inattaching to them a sense, and a supposititious signification, becausewe have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objectivereality. There exist also, however, usurped conceptions, such asfortune, fate, which circulate with almost universal indulgence, andyet are occasionally challenged by the question, “quid juris?” In suchcases, we have great difficulty in discovering any deduction for theseterms, inasmuch as we cannot produce any manifest ground of right,either from experience or from reason, on which the claim to employthem can be founded.Among the many conceptions, which make up the very variegated web ofhuman cognition, some are destined for pure use à priori, independentof all experience; and their title to be so employed always requires adeduction, inasmuch as, to justify such use of them, proofs fromexperience are not sufficient; but it is necessary to know how theseconceptions can apply to objects without being derived from experience.I term, therefore, an examination of the manner in which conceptionscan apply à priori to objects, the transcendental deduction ofconceptions, and I distinguish it from the empirical deduction, whichindicates the mode in which conception is obtained through experienceand reflection thereon; consequently, does not concern itself with theright, but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in such andsuch a manner. We have already seen that we are in possession of twoperfectly different kinds of conceptions, which nevertheless agree witheach other in this, that they both apply to objects completely àpriori. These are the conceptions of space and time as forms ofsensibility, and the categories as pure conceptions of theunderstanding. To attempt an empirical deduction of either of theseclasses would be labour in vain, because the distinguishingcharacteristic of their nature consists in this, that they apply totheir objects, without having borrowed anything from experience towardsthe representation of them. Consequently, if a deduction of theseconceptions is necessary, it must always be transcendental.Meanwhile, with respect to these conceptions, as with respect to allour cognition, we certainly may discover in experience, if not theprinciple of their possibility, yet the occasioning causes of theirproduction. It will be found that the impressions of sense give thefirst occasion for bringing into action the whole faculty of cognition,and for the production of experience, which contains two verydissimilar elements, namely, a matter for cognition, given by thesenses, and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter, arisingout of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought; and these, onoccasion given by sensuous impressions, are called into exercise andproduce conceptions. Such an investigation into the first efforts ofour faculty of cognition to mount from particular perceptions togeneral conceptions is undoubtedly of great utility; and we have tothank the celebrated Locke for having first opened the way for thisinquiry. But a deduction of the pure à priori conceptions of coursenever can be made in this way, seeing that, in regard to their futureemployment, which must be entirely independent of experience, they musthave a far different certificate of birth to show from that of adescent from experience. This attempted physiological derivation, whichcannot properly be called deduction, because it relates merely to aquaestio facti, I shall entitle an explanation of the possession of apure cognition. It is therefore manifest that there can only be atranscendental deduction of these conceptions and by no means anempirical one; also, that all attempts at an empirical deduction, inregard to pure à priori conceptions, are vain, and can only be made byone who does not understand the altogether peculiar nature of thesecognitions.But although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure àpriori cognition is a transcendental deduction, it is not, for thatreason, perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutelynecessary. We have already traced to their sources the conceptions ofspace and time, by means of a transcendental deduction, and we haveexplained and determined their objective validity à priori. Geometry,nevertheless, advances steadily and securely in the province of pure àpriori cognitions, without needing to ask from philosophy anycertificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamentalconception of space. But the use of the conception in this scienceextends only to the external world of sense, the pure form of theintuition of which is space; and in this world, therefore, allgeometrical cognition, because it is founded upon à priori intuition,possesses immediate evidence, and the objects of this cognition aregiven à priori (as regards their form) in intuition by and through thecognition itself. With the pure conceptions of understanding, on thecontrary, commences the absolute necessity of seeking a transcendentaldeduction, not only of these conceptions themselves, but likewise ofspace, because, inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning objectsnot by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility, but ofpure thought à priori, they apply to objects without any of theconditions of sensibility. Besides, not being founded on experience,they are not presented with any object in à priori intuition uponwhich, antecedently to experience, they might base their synthesis.Hence results, not only doubt as to the objective validity and properlimits of their use, but that even our conception of space is renderedequivocal; inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of thecategories, to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditionsof sensuous intuition—and, for this reason, we have already found atranscendental deduction of it needful. The reader, then, must be quiteconvinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction,before taking a single step in the field of pure reason; becauseotherwise he goes to work blindly, and after he has wondered about inall directions, returns to the state of utter ignorance from which hestarted. He ought, moreover, clearly to recognize beforehand theunavoidable difficulties in his undertaking, so that he may notafterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself isdeeply involved, or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in hispath; because we have a choice of only two things—either at once togive up all pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possibleexperience, or to bring this critical investigation to completion.We have been able, with very little trouble, to make it comprehensiblehow the conceptions of space and time, although à priori cognitions,must necessarily apply to external objects, and render a syntheticalcognition of these possible, independently of all experience. Forinasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an objectcan appear to us, that is, be an object of empirical intuition, spaceand time are pure intuitions, which contain à priori the condition ofthe possibility of objects as phenomena, and an à priori synthesis inthese intuitions possesses objective validity.On the other hand, the categories of the understanding do not representthe conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition;objects can consequently appear to us without necessarily connectingthemselves with these, and consequently without any necessity bindingon the understanding to contain à priori the conditions of theseobjects. Thus we find ourselves involved in a difficulty which did notpresent itself in the sphere of sensibility, that is to say, we cannotdiscover how the subjective conditions of thought can have objectivevalidity, in other words, can become conditions of the possibility ofall cognition of objects; for phenomena may certainly be given to us inintuition without any help from the functions of the understanding. Letus take, for example, the conception of cause, which indicates apeculiar kind of synthesis, namely, that with something, A, somethingentirely different, B, is connected according to a law. It is not àpriori manifest why phenomena should contain anything of this kind (weare of course debarred from appealing for proof to experience, for theobjective validity of this conception must be demonstrated à priori),and it hence remains doubtful à priori, whether such a conception benot quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomena.For that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formalconditions of sensibility existing à priori in the mind is quiteevident, from the fact that without these they could not be objects forus; but that they must also correspond to the conditions whichunderstanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought is anassertion, the grounds for which are not so easily to be discovered.For phenomena might be so constituted as not to correspond to theconditions of the unity of thought; and all things might lie in suchconfusion that, for example, nothing could be met with in the sphere ofphenomena to suggest a law of synthesis, and so correspond to theconception of cause and effect; so that this conception would be quitevoid, null, and without significance. Phenomena would neverthelesscontinue to present objects to our intuition; for mere intuition doesnot in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought.If we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigationsby saying: “Experience is constantly offering us examples of therelation of cause and effect in phenomena, and presents us withabundant opportunity of abstracting the conception of cause, and so atthe same time of corroborating the objective validity of thisconception”; we should in this case be overlooking the fact, that theconception of cause cannot arise in this way at all; that, on thecontrary, it must either have an à priori basis in the understanding,or be rejected as a mere chimera. For this conception demands thatsomething, A, should be of such a nature that something else, B, shouldfollow from it necessarily, and according to an absolutely universallaw. We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to whichthis or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to befound in it. Hence it is evident that to the synthesis of cause andeffect belongs a dignity, which is utterly wanting in any empiricalsynthesis; for it is no mere mechanical synthesis, by means ofaddition, but a dynamical one; that is to say, the effect is not to becogitated as merely annexed to the cause, but as posited by and throughthe cause, and resulting from it. The strict universality of this lawnever can be a characteristic of empirical laws, which obtain throughinduction only a comparative universality, that is, an extended rangeof practical application. But the pure conceptions of the understandingwould entirely lose all their peculiar character, if we treated themmerely as the productions of experience.Transition to the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories § 10There are only two possible ways in which synthetical representationand its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other,and, as it were, meet together. Either the object alone makes therepresentation possible, or the representation alone makes the objectpossible. In the former case, the relation between them is onlyempirical, and an à priori representation is impossible. And this isthe case with phenomena, as regards that in them which is referable tomere sensation. In the latter case—although representation alone (forof its causality, by means of the will, we do not here speak) does notproduce the object as to its existence, it must nevertheless be àpriori determinative in regard to the object, if it is only by means ofthe representation that we can cognize anything as an object. Now thereare only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects;firstly, intuition, by means of which the object, though only asphenomenon, is given; secondly, conception, by means of which theobject which corresponds to this intuition is thought. But it isevident from what has been said on æsthetic that the first condition,under which alone objects can be intuited, must in fact exist, as aformal basis for them, à priori in the mind. With this formal conditionof sensibility, therefore, all phenomena necessarily correspond,because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all; thatis, can be empirically intuited and given. Now the question is whetherthere do not exist, à priori in the mind, conceptions of understandingalso, as conditions under which alone something, if not intuited, isyet thought as object. If this question be answered in the affirmative,it follows that all empirical cognition of objects is necessarilyconformable to such conceptions, since, if they are not presupposed, itis impossible that anything can be an object of experience. Now allexperience contains, besides the intuition of the senses through whichan object is given, a conception also of an object that is given inintuition. Accordingly, conceptions of objects in general must lie as àpriori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition; andconsequently, the objective validity of the categories, as à prioriconceptions, will rest upon this, that experience (as far as regardsthe form of thought) is possible only by their means. For in that casethey apply necessarily and à priori to objects of experience, becauseonly through them can an object of experience be thought.The whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all à prioriconceptions is to show that these conceptions are à priori conditionsof the possibility of all experience. Conceptions which afford us theobjective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that veryreason necessary. But the analysis of the experiences in which they aremet with is not deduction, but only an illustration of them, becausefrom experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity.Without their original applicability and relation to all possibleexperience, in which all objects of cognition present themselves, therelation of the categories to objects, of whatever nature, would bequite incomprehensible.The celebrated Locke, for want of due reflection on these points, andbecause he met with pure conceptions of the understanding inexperience, sought also to deduce them from experience, and yetproceeded so inconsequently as to attempt, with their aid, to arrive itcognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all experience. DavidHume perceived that, to render this possible, it was necessary that theconceptions should have an à priori origin. But as he could not explainhow it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with eachother in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarilyconnected in the object—and it never occurred to him that theunderstanding itself might, perhaps, by means of these conceptions, bethe author of the experience in which its objects were presented toit—he was forced to drive these conceptions from experience, that is,from a subjective necessity arising from repeated association ofexperiences erroneously considered to be objective—in one word, fromhabit. But he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to beimpossible, with such conceptions and the principles arising from them,to overstep the limits of experience. The empirical derivation,however, which both of these philosophers attributed to theseconceptions, cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we dopossess scientific à priori cognitions, namely, those of puremathematics and general physics.The former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door toextravagance—(for if reason has once undoubted right on its side, itwill not allow itself to be confined to set limits, by vaguerecommendations of moderation); the latter gave himself up entirely toscepticism—a natural consequence, after having discovered, as hethought, that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy. We nowintend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conductreason between these two rocks, to assign her determinate limits, andyet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity.I shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are. Theyare conceptions of an object in general, by means of which itsintuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of thelogical functions of judgement. The following will make this plain. Thefunction of the categorical judgement is that of the relation ofsubject to predicate; for example, in the proposition: “All bodies aredivisible.” But in regard to the merely logical use of theunderstanding, it still remains undetermined to which Of these twoconceptions belongs the function Of subject and to which that ofpredicate. For we could also say: “Some divisible is a body.” But thecategory of substance, when the conception of a body is brought underit, determines that; and its empirical intuition in experience must becontemplated always as subject and never as mere predicate. And so withall the other categories.Section II Transcendental Deduction of the pure Conceptions of theUnderstandingOf the Possibility of a Conjunction of the manifold representationsgiven by Sense § 11.The manifold content in our representations can be given in anintuition which is merely sensuous—in other words, is nothing butsusceptibility; and the form of this intuition can exist à priori inour faculty of representation, without being anything else but the modein which the subject is affected. But the conjunction (conjunctio) of amanifold in intuition never can be given us by the senses; it cannottherefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous intuition, for itis a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation. And as we must,to distinguish it from sensibility, entitle this faculty understanding;so all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious, be it of themanifold in intuition, sensuous or non-sensuous, or of severalconceptions—is an act of the understanding. To this act we shall givethe general appellation of synthesis, thereby to indicate, at the sametime, that we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the objectwithout having previously conjoined it ourselves. Of all mentalnotions, that of conjunction is the only one which cannot be giventhrough objects, but can be originated only by the subject itself,because it is an act of its purely spontaneous activity. The readerwill easily enough perceive that the possibility of conjunction must begrounded in the very nature of this act, and that it must be equallyvalid for all conjunction, and that analysis, which appears to be itscontrary, must, nevertheless, always presuppose it; for where theunderstanding has not previously conjoined, it cannot dissect oranalyse, because only as conjoined by it, must that which is to beanalysed have been given to our faculty of representation.But the conception of conjunction includes, besides the conception ofthe manifold and of the synthesis of it, that of the unity of it also.Conjunction is the representation of the synthetical unity of themanifold.[15] This idea of unity, therefore, cannot arise out of thatof conjunction; much rather does that idea, by combining itself withthe representation of the manifold, render the conception ofconjunction possible. This unity, which à priori precedes allconceptions of conjunction, is not the category of unity (§ 6); for allthe categories are based upon logical functions of judgement, and inthese functions we already have conjunction, and consequently unity ofgiven conceptions. It is therefore evident that the category of unitypresupposes conjunction. We must therefore look still higher for thisunity (as qualitative, § 8), in that, namely, which contains the groundof the unity of diverse conceptions in judgements, the ground,consequently, of the possibility of the existence of the understanding,even in regard to its logical use. [15] Whether the representations are in themselves identical, and consequently whether one can be thought analytically by means of and through the other, is a question which we need not at present consider. Our Consciousness of the one, when we speak of the manifold, is always distinguishable from our consciousness of the other; and it is only respecting the synthesis of this (possible) consciousness that we here treat.Of the Originally Synthetical Unity of Apperception § 12The “I think” must accompany all my representations, for otherwisesomething would be represented in me which could not be thought; inother words, the representation would either be impossible, or at leastbe, in relation to me, nothing. That representation which can be givenpreviously to all thought is called intuition. All the diversity ormanifold content of intuition, has, therefore, a necessary relation tothe “I think,” in the subject in which this diversity is found. Butthis representation, “I think,” is an act of spontaneity; that is tosay, it cannot be regarded as belonging to mere sensibility. I call itpure apperception, in order to distinguish it from empirical; orprimitive apperception, because it is self-consciousness which, whilstit gives birth to the representation “I think,” must necessarily becapable of accompanying all our representations. It is in all acts ofconsciousness one and the same, and unaccompanied by it, norepresentation can exist for me. The unity of this apperception I callthe transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicatethe possibility of à priori cognition arising from it. For the manifoldrepresentations which are given in an intuition would not all of thembe my representations, if they did not all belong to oneself-consciousness, that is, as my representations (even although I amnot conscious of them as such), they must conform to the conditionunder which alone they can exist together in a commonself-consciousness, because otherwise they would not all withoutexception belong to me. From this primitive conjunction follow manyimportant results.For example, this universal identity of the apperception of themanifold given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations andis possible only by means of the consciousness of this synthesis. Forthe empirical consciousness which accompanies different representationsis in itself fragmentary and disunited, and without relation to theidentity of the subject. This relation, then, does not exist because Iaccompany every representation with consciousness, but because I joinone representation to another, and am conscious of the synthesis ofthem. Consequently, only because I can connect a variety of givenrepresentations in one consciousness, is it possible that I canrepresent to myself the identity of consciousness in theserepresentations; in other words, the analytical unity of apperceptionis possible only under the presupposition of a synthetical unity.[16]The thought, “These representations given in intuition belong all ofthem to me,” is accordingly just the same as, “I unite them in oneself-consciousness, or can at least so unite them”; and although thisthought is not itself the consciousness of the synthesis ofrepresentations, it presupposes the possibility of it; that is to say,for the reason alone that I can comprehend the variety of myrepresentations in one consciousness, do I call them myrepresentations, for otherwise I must have as many-coloured and variousa self as are the representations of which I am conscious. Syntheticalunity of the manifold in intuitions, as given à priori, is thereforethe foundation of the identity of apperception itself, which antecedesà priori all determinate thought. But the conjunction ofrepresentations into a conception is not to be found in objectsthemselves, nor can it be, as it were, borrowed from them and taken upinto the understanding by perception, but it is on the contrary anoperation of the understanding itself, which is nothing more than thefaculty of conjoining à priori and of bringing the variety of givenrepresentations under the unity of apperception. This principle is thehighest in all human cognition. [16] All general conceptions—as such—depend, for their existence, on the analytical unity of consciousness. For example, when I think of red in general, I thereby think to myself a property which (as a characteristic mark) can be discovered somewhere, or can be united with other representations; consequently, it is only by means of a forethought possible synthetical unity that I can think to myself the analytical. A representation which is cogitated as common to different representations, is regarded as belonging to such as, besides this common representation, contain something different; consequently it must be previously thought in synthetical unity with other although only possible representations, before I can think in it the analytical unity of consciousness which makes it a conceptas communis. And thus the synthetical unity of apperception is the highest point with which we must connect every operation of the understanding, even the whole of logic, and after it our transcendental philosophy; indeed, this faculty is the understanding itself.This fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception isindeed an identical, and therefore analytical, proposition; but itnevertheless explains the necessity for a synthesis of the manifoldgiven in an intuition, without which the identity of self-consciousnesswould be incogitable. For the ego, as a simple representation, presentsus with no manifold content; only in intuition, which is quitedifferent from the representation ego, can it be given us, and by meansof conjunction it is cogitated in one self-consciousness. Anunderstanding, in which all the manifold should be given by means ofconsciousness itself, would be intuitive; our understanding can onlythink and must look for its intuition to sense. I am, therefore,conscious of my identical self, in relation to all the variety ofrepresentations given to me in an intuition, because I call all of themmy representations. In other words, I am conscious myself of anecessary à priori synthesis of my representations, which is called theoriginal synthetical unity of apperception, under which rank all therepresentations presented to me, but that only by means of a synthesis.The Principle of the Synthetical Unity of Apperception is the highestPrinciple of all exercise of the Understanding § 13The supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relationto sensibility was, according to our transcendental æsthetic, that allthe manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of spaceand time. The supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation tothe understanding is that all the manifold in it be subject toconditions of the originally synthetical unity or apperception.[17] Tothe former of these two principles are subject all the variousrepresentations of intuition, in so far as they are given to us; to thelatter, in so far as they must be capable of conjunction in oneconsciousness; for without this nothing can be thought or cognized,because the given representations would not have in common the act Ofthe apperception “I think” and therefore could not be connected in oneself-consciousness. [17] Space and time, and all portions thereof, are intuitions; consequently are, with a manifold for their content, single representations. (See the Transcendental Æsthetic.) Consequently, they are not pure conceptions, by means of which the same consciousness is found in a great number of representations; but, on the contrary, they are many representations contained in one, the consciousness of which is, so to speak, compounded. The unity of consciousness is nevertheless synthetical and, therefore, primitive. From this peculiar character of consciousness follow many important consequences. (See § 21.)Understanding is, to speak generally, the faculty Of cognitions. Theseconsist in the determined relation of given representation to anobject. But an object is that, in the conception of which the manifoldin a given intuition is united. Now all union of representationsrequires unity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently,it is the unity of consciousness alone that constitutes the possibilityof representations relating to an object, and therefore of theirobjective validity, and of their becoming cognitions, and consequently,the possibility of the existence of the understanding itself.The first pure cognition of understanding, then, upon which is foundedall its other exercise, and which is at the same time perfectlyindependent of all conditions of mere sensuous intuition, is theprinciple of the original synthetical unity of apperception. Thus themere form of external sensuous intuition, namely, space, affords us,per se, no cognition; it merely contributes the manifold in à prioriintuition to a possible cognition. But, in order to cognize somethingin space (for example, a line), I must draw it, and thus producesynthetically a determined conjunction of the given manifold, so thatthe unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness(in the conception of a line), and by this means alone is an object (adeterminate space) cognized. The synthetical unity of consciousness is,therefore, an objective condition of all cognition, which I do notmerely require in order to cognize an object, but to which everyintuition must necessarily be subject, in order to become an object forme; because in any other way, and without this synthesis, the manifoldin intuition could not be united in one consciousness.This proposition is, as already said, itself analytical, although itconstitutes the synthetical unity, the condition of all thought; for itstates nothing more than that all my representations in any givenintuition must be subject to the condition which alone enables me toconnect them, as my representation with the identical self, and so tounite them synthetically in one apperception, by means of the generalexpression, “I think.”But this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for everypossible understanding, but only for the understanding by means ofwhose pure apperception in the thought I am, no manifold content isgiven. The understanding or mind which contained the manifold inintuition, in and through the act itself of its own self-consciousness,in other words, an understanding by and in the representation of whichthe objects of the representation should at the same time exist, wouldnot require a special act of synthesis of the manifold as the conditionof the unity of its consciousness, an act of which the humanunderstanding, which thinks only and cannot intuite, has absolute need.But this principle is the first principle of all the operations of ourunderstanding, so that we cannot form the least conception of any otherpossible understanding, either of one such as should be itselfintuition, or possess a sensuous intuition, but with forms differentfrom those of space and time.What Objective Unity of Self-consciousness is § 14It is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all themanifold, given in an intuition is united into a conception of theobject. On this account it is called objective, and must bedistinguished from the subjective unity of consciousness, which is adetermination of the internal sense, by means of which the saidmanifold in intuition is given empirically to be so united. Whether Ican be empirically conscious of the manifold as coexistent or assuccessive, depends upon circumstances, or empirical conditions. Hencethe empirical unity of consciousness by means of association ofrepresentations, itself relates to a phenomenal world and is whollycontingent. On the contrary, the pure form of intuition in time, merelyas an intuition, which contains a given manifold, is subject to theoriginal unity of consciousness, and that solely by means of thenecessary relation of the manifold in intuition to the “I think,”consequently by means of the pure synthesis of the understanding, whichlies à priori at the foundation of all empirical synthesis. Thetranscendental unity of apperception is alone objectively valid; theempirical which we do not consider in this essay, and which is merely aunity deduced from the former under given conditions in concreto,possesses only subjective validity. One person connects the notionconveyed in a word with one thing, another with another thing; and theunity of consciousness in that which is empirical, is, in relation tothat which is given by experience, not necessarily and universallyvalid.The Logical Form of all Judgements consists in the Objective Unity ofApperception of the Conceptions contained therein § 15I could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians giveof a judgement. It is, according to them, the representation of arelation between two conceptions. I shall not dwell here on thefaultiness of this definition, in that it suits only for categoricaland not for hypothetical or disjunctive judgements, these lattercontaining a relation not of conceptions but of judgements themselves—ablunder from which many evil results have followed.[18] It is moreimportant for our present purpose to observe, that this definition doesnot determine in what the said relation consists. [18] The tedious doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns only categorical syllogisms; and although it is nothing more than an artifice by surreptitiously introducing immediate conclusions (consequentiae immediatae) among the premises of a pure syllogism, to give ism give rise to an appearance of more modes of drawing a conclusion than that in the first figure, the artifice would not have had much success, had not its authors succeeded in bringing categorical judgements into exclusive respect, as those to which all others must be referred—a doctrine, however, which, according to § 5, is utterly false.But if I investigate more closely the relation of given cognitions inevery judgement, and distinguish it, as belonging to the understanding,from the relation which is produced according to laws of thereproductive imagination (which has only subjective validity), I findthat judgement is nothing but the mode of bringing given cognitionsunder the objective unit of apperception. This is plain from our use ofthe term of relation is in judgements, in order to distinguish theobjective unity of given representations from the subjective unity. Forthis term indicates the relation of these representations to theoriginal apperception, and also their necessary unity, even althoughthe judgement is empirical, therefore contingent, as in the judgement:“All bodies are heavy.” I do not mean by this, that theserepresentations do necessarily belong to each other in empiricalintuition, but that by means of the necessary unity of appreciationthey belong to each other in the synthesis of intuitions, that is tosay, they belong to each other according to principles of the objectivedetermination of all our representations, in so far as cognition canarise from them, these principles being all deduced from the mainprinciple of the transcendental unity of apperception. In this wayalone can there arise from this relation a judgement, that is, arelation which has objective validity, and is perfectly distinct fromthat relation of the very same representations which has onlysubjective validity—a relation, to wit, which is produced according tolaws of association. According to these laws, I could only say: “When Ihold in my hand or carry a body, I feel an impression of weight”; but Icould not say: “It, the body, is heavy”; for this is tantamount tosaying both these representations are conjoined in the object, that is,without distinction as to the condition of the subject, and do notmerely stand together in my perception, however frequently theperceptive act may be repeated.All Sensuous Intuitions are subject to the Categories, as Conditionsunder which alone the manifold Content of them can be united in oneConsciousness § 16The manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarilyunder the original synthetical unity of apperception, because therebyalone is the unity of intuition possible (§ 13). But that act of theunderstanding, by which the manifold content of given representations(whether intuitions or conceptions) is brought under one apperception,is the logical function of judgements (§ 15). All the manifold,therefore, in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition, isdetermined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement, bymeans of which it is brought into union in one consciousness. Now thecategories are nothing else than these functions of judgement so far asthe manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them (§9). Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is necessarilysubject to the categories of the understanding.Observation § 17The manifold in an intuition, which I call mine, is represented bymeans of the synthesis of the understanding, as belonging to thenecessary unity of self-consciousness, and this takes place by means ofthe category.[19] The category indicates accordingly that the empiricalconsciousness of a given manifold in an intuition is subject to a pureself-consciousness à priori, in the same manner as an empiricalintuition is subject to a pure sensuous intuition, which is also àpriori. In the above proposition, then, lies the beginning of adeduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding. Now, as thecategories have their origin in the understanding alone, independentlyof sensibility, I must in my deduction make abstraction of the mode inwhich the manifold of an empirical intuition is given, in order to fixmy attention exclusively on the unity which is brought by theunderstanding into the intuition by means of the category. In whatfollows (§ 22), it will be shown, from the mode in which the empiricalintuition is given in the faculty of sensibility, that the unity whichbelongs to it is no other than that which the category (according to §16) imposes on the manifold in a given intuition, and thus, its àpriori validity in regard to all objects of sense being established,the purpose of our deduction will be fully attained. [19] The proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition, by means of which an object is given, and which always includes in itself a synthesis of the manifold to be intuited, and also the relation of this latter to unity of apperception.But there is one thing in the above demonstration of which I could notmake abstraction, namely, that the manifold to be intuited must begiven previously to the synthesis of the understanding, andindependently of it. How this takes place remains here undetermined.For if I cogitate an understanding which was itself intuitive (as, forexample, a divine understanding which should not represent givenobjects, but by whose representation the objects themselves should begiven or produced), the categories would possess no significance inrelation to such a faculty of cognition. They are merely rules for anunderstanding, whose whole power consists in thought, that is, in theact of submitting the synthesis of the manifold which is presented toit in intuition from a very different quarter, to the unity ofapperception; a faculty, therefore, which cognizes nothing per se, butonly connects and arranges the material of cognition, the intuition,namely, which must be presented to it by means of the object. But toshow reasons for this peculiar character of our understandings, that itproduces unity of apperception à priori only by means of categories,and a certain kind and number thereof, is as impossible as to explainwhy we are endowed with precisely so many functions of judgement and nomore, or why time and space are the only forms of our intuition.In Cognition, its Application to Objects of Experience is the onlylegitimate use of the Category § 18To think an object and to cognize an object are by no means the samething. In cognition there are two elements: firstly, the conception,whereby an object is cogitated (the category); and, secondly, theintuition, whereby the object is given. For supposing that to theconception a corresponding intuition could not be given, it would stillbe a thought as regards its form, but without any object, and nocognition of anything would be possible by means of it, inasmuch as, sofar as I knew, there existed and could exist nothing to which mythought could be applied. Now all intuition possible to us is sensuous;consequently, our thought of an object by means of a pure conception ofthe understanding, can become cognition for us only in so far as thisconception is applied to objects of the senses. Sensuous intuition iseither pure intuition (space and time) or empirical intuition—of thatwhich is immediately represented in space and time by means ofsensation as real. Through the determination of pure intuition weobtain à priori cognitions of objects, as in mathematics, but only asregards their form as phenomena; whether there can exist things whichmust be intuited in this form is not thereby established. Allmathematical conceptions, therefore, are not per se cognition, exceptin so far as we presuppose that there exist things which can only berepresented conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition. Butthings in space and time are given only in so far as they areperceptions (representations accompanied with sensation), thereforeonly by empirical representation. Consequently the pure conceptions ofthe understanding, even when they are applied to intuitions à priori(as in mathematics), produce cognition only in so far as these (andtherefore the conceptions of the understanding by means of them) can beapplied to empirical intuitions. Consequently the categories do not,even by means of pure intuition afford us any cognition of things; theycan only do so in so far as they can be applied to empirical intuition.That is to say, the categories serve only to render empirical cognitionpossible. But this is what we call experience. Consequently, incognition, their application to objects of experience is the onlylegitimate use of the categories.§ 19The foregoing proposition is of the utmost importance, for itdetermines the limits of the exercise of the pure conceptions of theunderstanding in regard to objects, just as transcendental æstheticdetermined the limits of the exercise of the pure form of our sensuousintuition. Space and time, as conditions of the possibility of thepresentation of objects to us, are valid no further than for objects ofsense, consequently, only for experience. Beyond these limits theyrepresent to us nothing, for they belong only to sense, and have noreality apart from it. The pure conceptions of the understanding arefree from this limitation, and extend to objects of intuition ingeneral, be the intuition like or unlike to ours, provided only it besensuous, and not intellectual. But this extension of conceptionsbeyond the range of our intuition is of no advantage; for they are thenmere empty conceptions of objects, as to the possibility orimpossibility of the existence of which they furnish us with no meansof discovery. They are mere forms of thought, without objectivereality, because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity ofapperception, which alone the categories contain, could be applied, forthe purpose of determining an object. Our sensuous and empiricalintuition can alone give them significance and meaning.If, then, we suppose an object of a non-sensuous intuition to be givenwe can in that case represent it by all those predicates which areimplied in the presupposition that nothing appertaining to sensuousintuition belongs to it; for example, that it is not extended, or inspace; that its duration is not time; that in it no change (the effectof the determinations in time) is to be met with, and so on. But it isno proper knowledge if I merely indicate what the intuition of theobject is not, without being able to say what is contained in it, for Ihave not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure conceptionof understanding could be applicable, because I have not been able tofurnish any intuition corresponding to it, but am only able to say thatour intuition is not valid for it. But the most important point isthis, that to a something of this kind not one category can be foundapplicable. Take, for example, the conception of substance, that is,something that can exist as subject, but never as mere predicate; inregard to this conception I am quite ignorant whether there can reallybe anything to correspond to such a determination of thought, ifempirical intuition did not afford me the occasion for its application.But of this more in the sequel.Of the Application of the Categories to Objects of the Senses ingeneral § 20The pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuitionin general, through the understanding alone, whether the intuition beour own or some other, provided only it be sensuous, but are, for thisvery reason, mere forms of thought, by means of which alone nodetermined object can be cognized. The synthesis or conjunction of themanifold in these conceptions relates, we have said, only to the unityof apperception, and is for this reason the ground of the possibilityof à priori cognition, in so far as this cognition is dependent on theunderstanding. This synthesis is, therefore, not merely transcendental,but also purely intellectual. But because a certain form of sensuousintuition exists in the mind à priori which rests on the receptivity ofthe representative faculty (sensibility), the understanding, as aspontaneity, is able to determine the internal sense by means of thediversity of given representations, conformably to the syntheticalunity of apperception, and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity ofthe apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition à priori, as thecondition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of humanintuition. And in this manner the categories as mere forms of thoughtreceive objective reality, that is, application to objects which aregiven to us in intuition, but that only as phenomena, for it is only ofphenomena that we are capable of à priori intuition.This synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition, which is possibleand necessary à priori, may be called figurative (synthesis speciosa),in contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category inregard to the manifold of an intuition in general, and is calledconnection or conjunction of the understanding (synthesisintellectualis). Both are transcendental, not merely because theythemselves precede à priori all experience, but also because they formthe basis for the possibility of other cognition à priori.But the figurative synthesis, when it has relation only to theoriginally synthetical unity of apperception, that is to thetranscendental unity cogitated in the categories, must, to bedistinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction, be entitled thetranscendental synthesis of imagination. Imagination is the faculty ofrepresenting an object even without its presence in intuition. Now, asall our intuition is sensuous, imagination, by reason of the subjectivecondition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition tothe conceptions of the understanding, belongs to sensibility. But in sofar as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity, whichis determinative, and not, like sense, merely determinable, and whichis consequently able to determine sense à priori, according to itsform, conformably to the unity of apperception, in so far is theimagination a faculty of determining sensibility à priori, and itssynthesis of intuitions according to the categories must be thetranscendental synthesis of the imagination. It is an operation of theunderstanding on sensibility, and the first application of theunderstanding to objects of possible intuition, and at the same timethe basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty. Asfigurative, it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis,which is produced by the understanding alone, without the aid ofimagination. Now, in so far as imagination is spontaneity, I sometimescall it also the productive imagination, and distinguish it from thereproductive, the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empiricallaws, those of association, namely, and which, therefore, contributesnothing to the explanation of the possibility of à priori cognition,and for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy, but topsychology.We have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradoxwhich must have struck every one in our exposition of the internalsense (§ 6), namely—how this sense represents us to our ownconsciousness, only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are inourselves, because, to wit, we intuite ourselves only as we areinwardly affected. Now this appears to be contradictory, inasmuch as wethus stand in a passive relation to ourselves; and therefore in thesystems of psychology, the internal sense is commonly held to be onewith the faculty of apperception, while we, on the contrary, carefullydistinguish them.That which determines the internal sense is the understanding, and itsoriginal power of conjoining the manifold of intuition, that is, ofbringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibilityof the understanding itself). Now, as the human understanding is not initself a faculty of intuition, and is unable to exercise such a power,in order to conjoin, as it were, the manifold of its own intuition, thesynthesis of understanding is, considered per se, nothing but the unityof action, of which, as such, it is self-conscious, even apart fromsensibility, by which, moreover, it is able to determine our internalsense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it accordingto the form of sensuous intuition. Thus, under the name of atranscendental synthesis of imagination, the understanding exercises anactivity upon the passive subject, whose faculty it is; and so we areright in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby.Apperception and its synthetical unity are by no means one and the samewith the internal sense. The former, as the source of all oursynthetical conjunction, applies, under the name of the categories, tothe manifold of intuition in general, prior to all sensuous intuitionof objects. The internal sense, on the contrary, contains merely theform of intuition, but without any synthetical conjunction of themanifold therein, and consequently does not contain any determinedintuition, which is possible only through consciousness of thedetermination of the manifold by the transcendental act of theimagination (synthetical influence of the understanding on the internalsense), which I have named figurative synthesis.This we can indeed always perceive in ourselves. We cannot cogitate ageometrical line without drawing it in thought, nor a circle withoutdescribing it, nor represent the three dimensions of space withoutdrawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another.We cannot even cogitate time, unless, in drawing a straight line (whichis to serve as the external figurative representation of time), we fixour attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold, whereby wedetermine successively the internal sense, and thus attend also to thesuccession of this determination. Motion as an act of the subject (notas a determination of an object),[20] consequently the synthesis of themanifold in space, if we make abstraction of space and attend merely tothe act by which we determine the internal sense according to its form,is that which produces the conception of succession. The understanding,therefore, does by no means find in the internal sense any suchsynthesis of the manifold, but produces it, in that it affects thissense. At the same time, how “I who think” is distinct from the “i”which intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as atleast possible), and yet one and the same with this latter as the samesubject; how, therefore, I am able to say: “I, as an intelligence andthinking subject, cognize myself as an object thought, so far as I am,moreover, given to myself in intuition—only, like other phenomena, notas I am in myself, and as considered by the understanding, but merelyas I appear”—is a question that has in it neither more nor lessdifficulty than the question—“How can I be an object to myself?” orthis—“How I can be an object of my own intuition and internalperceptions?” But that such must be the fact, if we admit that space ismerely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense, can be clearlyproved by the consideration that we cannot represent time, which is notan object of external intuition, in any other way than under the imageof a line, which we draw in thought, a mode of representation withoutwhich we could not cognize the unity of its dimension, and also that weare necessitated to take our determination of periods of time, or ofpoints of time, for all our internal perceptions from the changes whichwe perceive in outward things. It follows that we must arrange thedeterminations of the internal sense, as phenomena in time, exactly inthe same manner as we arrange those of the external senses in space.And consequently, if we grant, respecting this latter, that by means ofthem we know objects only in so far as we are affected externally, wemust also confess, with regard to the internal sense, that by means ofit we intuite ourselves only as we are internally affected byourselves; in other words, as regards internal intuition, we cognizeour own subject only as phenomenon, and not as it is in itself.[21] [20] Motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science, consequently not to geometry; because, that a thing is movable cannot be known à priori, but only from experience. But motion, considered as the description of a space, is a pure act of the successive synthesis of the manifold in external intuition by means of productive imagination, and belongs not only to geometry, but even to transcendental philosophy. [21] I do not see why so much difficulty should be found in admitting that our internal sense is affected by ourselves. Every act of attention exemplifies it. In such an act the understanding determines the internal sense by the synthetical conjunction which it cogitates, conformably to the internal intuition which corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the understanding. How much the mind is usually affected thereby every one will be able to perceive in himself.§ 21On the other hand, in the transcendental synthesis of the manifoldcontent of representations, consequently in the synthetical unity ofapperception, I am conscious of myself, not as I appear to myself, noras I am in myself, but only that “I am.” This representation is athought, not an intuition. Now, as in order to cognize ourselves, inaddition to the act of thinking, which subjects the manifold of everypossible intuition to the unity of apperception, there is necessary adeterminate mode of intuition, whereby this manifold is given; althoughmy own existence is certainly not mere phenomenon (much less mereillusion), the determination of my existence[22] Can only take placeconformably to the form of the internal sense, according to theparticular mode in which the manifold which I conjoin is given ininternal intuition, and I have therefore no knowledge of myself as Iam, but merely as I appear to myself. The consciousness of self is thusvery far from a knowledge of self, in which I do not use thecategories, whereby I cogitate an object, by means of the conjunctionof the manifold in one apperception. In the same way as I require, forthe sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself, not onlythe thought of an object in general (in the category), but also anintuition by which to determine that general conception, in the sameway do I require, in order to the cognition of myself, not only theconsciousness of myself or the thought that I think myself, but inaddition an intuition of the manifold in myself, by which to determinethis thought. It is true that I exist as an intelligence which isconscious only of its faculty of conjunction or synthesis, butsubjected in relation to the manifold which this intelligence has toconjoin to a limitative conjunction called the internal sense. Myintelligence (that is, I) can render that conjunction or synthesisperceptible only according to the relations of time, which are quitebeyond the proper sphere of the conceptions of the understanding andconsequently cognize itself in respect to an intuition (which cannotpossibly be intellectual, nor given by the understanding), only as itappears to itself, and not as it would cognize itself, if its intuitionwere intellectual. [22] The “I think” expresses the act of determining my own existence. My existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness; but the mode in which I must determine my existence, that is, the mode in which I must place the manifold belonging to my existence, is not thereby given. For this purpose intuition of self is required, and this intuition possesses a form given à priori, namely, time, which is sensuous, and belongs to our receptivity of the determinable. Now, as I do not possess another intuition of self which gives the determining in me (of the spontaneity of which I am conscious), prior to the act of determination, in the same manner as time gives the determinable, it is clear that I am unable to determine my own existence as that of a spontaneous being, but I am only able to represent to myself the spontaneity of my thought, that is, of my determination, and my existence remains ever determinable in a purely sensuous manner, that is to say, like the existence of a phenomenon. But it is because of this spontaneity that I call myself an intelligence.Transcendental Deduction of the universally possible employment inexperience of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding § 22In the metaphysical deduction, the à priori origin of categories wasproved by their complete accordance with the general logical ofthought; in the transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibilityof the categories as à priori cognitions of objects of an intuition ingeneral (§ 16 and 17).At present we are about to explain thepossibility of cognizing, à priori, by means of the categories, allobjects which can possibly be presented to our senses, not, indeed,according to the form of their intuition, but according to the laws oftheir conjunction or synthesis, and thus, as it were, of prescribinglaws to nature and even of rendering nature possible. For if thecategories were inadequate to this task, it would not be evident to uswhy everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to thoselaws which have an à priori origin in the understanding itself.I premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension I understand thecombination of the manifold in an empirical intuition, wherebyperception, that is, empirical consciousness of the intuition (asphenomenon), is possible.We have à priori forms of the external and internal sensuous intuitionin the representations of space and time, and to these must thesynthesis of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be alwayscomformable, because the synthesis itself can only take place accordingto these forms. But space and time are not merely forms of sensuousintuition, but intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), andtherefore contain à priori the determination of the unity of thismanifold.[23] (See the Transcendent Æsthetic.) Therefore is unity ofthe synthesis of the manifold without or within us, consequently also aconjunction to which all that is to be represented as determined inspace or time must correspond, given à priori along with (not in) theseintuitions, as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension ofthem. But this synthetical unity can be no other than that of theconjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general, in aprimitive act of consciousness, according to the categories, butapplied to our sensuous intuition. Consequently all synthesis, wherebyalone is even perception possible, is subject to the categories. And,as experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions, thecategories are conditions of the possibility of experience and aretherefore valid à priori for all objects of experience. [23] Space represented as an object (as geometry really requires it to be) contains more than the mere form of the intuition; namely, a combination of the manifold given according to the form of sensibility into a representation that can be intuited; so that the form of the intuition gives us merely the manifold, but the formal intuition gives unity of representation. In the æsthetic, I regarded this unity as belonging entirely to sensibility, for the purpose of indicating that it antecedes all conceptions, although it presupposes a synthesis which does not belong to sense, through which alone, however, all our conceptions of space and time are possible. For as by means of this unity alone (the understanding determining the sensibility) space and time are given as intuitions, it follows that the unity of this intuition à priori belongs to space and time, and not to the conception of the understanding (§ 20).When, then, for example, I make the empirical intuition of a house byapprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception, thenecessary unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lies atthe foundation of this act, and I, as it were, draw the form of thehouse conformably to this synthetical unity of the manifold in space.But this very synthetical unity remains, even when I abstract the formof space, and has its seat in the understanding, and is in fact thecategory of the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition; that isto say, the category of quantity, to which the aforesaid synthesis ofapprehension, that is, the perception, must be completelyconformable.[24] [24] In this manner it is proved, that the synthesis of apprehension, which is empirical, must necessarily be conformable to the synthesis of apperception, which is intellectual, and contained à priori in the category. It is one and the same spontaneity which at one time, under the name of imagination, at another under that of understanding, produces conjunction in the manifold of intuition.To take another example, when I perceive the freezing of water, Iapprehend two states (fluidity and solidity), which, as such, standtoward each other mutually in a relation of time. But in the time,which I place as an internal intuition, at the foundation of thisphenomenon, I represent to myself synthetical unity of the manifold,without which the aforesaid relation could not be given in an intuitionas determined (in regard to the succession of time). Now thissynthetical unity, as the à priori condition under which I conjoin themanifold of an intuition, is, if I make abstraction of the permanentform of my internal intuition (that is to say, of time), the categoryof cause, by means of which, when applied to my sensibility, Idetermine everything that occurs according to relations of time.Consequently apprehension in such an event, and the event itself, asfar as regards the possibility of its perception, stands under theconception of the relation of cause and effect: and so in all othercases.Categories are conceptions which prescribe laws à priori to phenomena,consequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena (naturamaterialiter spectata). And now the question arises—inasmuch as thesecategories are not derived from nature, and do not regulate themselvesaccording to her as their model (for in that case they would beempirical)—how it is conceivable that nature must regulate herselfaccording to them, in other words, how the categories can determine àpriori the synthesis of the manifold of nature, and yet not derivetheir origin from her. The following is the solution of this enigma.It is not in the least more difficult to conceive how the laws of thephenomena of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with itsà priori form—that is, its faculty of conjoining the manifold—than itis to understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with theà priori form of our sensuous intuition. For laws do not exist in thephenomena any more than the phenomena exist as things in themselves.Laws do not exist except by relation to the subject in which thephenomena inhere, in so far as it possesses understanding, just asphenomena have no existence except by relation to the same existingsubject in so far as it has senses. To things as things in themselves,conformability to law must necessarily belong independently of anunderstanding to cognize them. But phenomena are only representationsof things which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are inthemselves. But as mere representations, they stand under no law ofconjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes. Nowthat which conjoins the manifold of sensuous intuition is imagination,a mental act to which understanding contributes unity of intellectualsynthesis, and sensibility, manifoldness of apprehension. Now as allpossible perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension, and thisempirical synthesis itself on the transcendental, consequently on thecategories, it is evident that all possible perceptions, and thereforeeverything that can attain to empirical consciousness, that is, allphenomena of nature, must, as regards their conjunction, be subject tothe categories. And nature (considered merely as nature in general) isdependent on them, as the original ground of her necessaryconformability to law (as natura formaliter spectata). But the purefaculty (of the understanding) of prescribing laws à priori tophenomena by means of mere categories, is not competent to enounceother or more laws than those on which a nature in general, as aconformability to law of phenomena of space and time, depends.Particular laws, inasmuch as they concern empirically determinedphenomena, cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws, although they allstand under them. Experience must be superadded in order to know theseparticular laws; but in regard to experience in general, and everythingthat can be cognized as an object thereof, these à priori laws are ouronly rule and guide.Result of this Deduction of the Conceptions of the Understanding § 23We cannot think any object except by means of the categories; we cannotcognize any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding tothese conceptions. Now all our intuitions are sensuous, and ourcognition, in so far as the object of it is given, is empirical. Butempirical cognition is experience; consequently no à priori cognitionis possible for us, except of objects of possible experience.[25] [25] Lest my readers should stumble at this assertion, and the conclusions that may be too rashly drawn from it, I must remind them that the categories in the act of thought are by no means limited by the conditions of our sensuous intuition, but have an unbounded sphere of action. It is only the cognition of the object of thought, the determining of the object, which requires intuition. In the absence of intuition, our thought of an object may still have true and useful consequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject. But as this exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination of the object, in other words, on cognition thereof, but also on the determination of the subject and its volition, I do not intend to treat of it in this place.But this cognition, which is limited to objects of experience, is notfor that reason derived entirely, from, experience, but—and this isasserted of the pure intuitions and the pure conceptions of theunderstanding—there are, unquestionably, elements of cognition, whichexist in the mind à priori. Now there are only two ways in which anecessary harmony of experience with the conceptions of its objects canbe cogitated. Either experience makes these conceptions possible, orthe conceptions make experience possible. The former of thesestatements will not hold good with respect to the categories (nor inregard to pure sensuous intuition), for they are à priori conceptions,and therefore independent of experience. The assertion of an empiricalorigin would attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca.Consequently, nothing remains but to adopt the second alternative(which presents us with a system, as it were, of the epigenesis of purereason), namely, that on the part of the understanding the categoriesdo contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience. But withrespect to the questions how they make experience possible, and whatare the principles of the possibility thereof with which they presentus in their application to phenomena, the following section on thetranscendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform thereader.It is quite possible that someone may propose a species ofpreformation-system of pure reason—a middle way between the two—to wit,that the categories are neither innate and first à priori principles ofcognition, nor derived from experience, but are merely subjectiveaptitudes for thought implanted in us contemporaneously with ourexistence, which were so ordered and disposed by our Creator, thattheir exercise perfectly harmonizes with the laws of nature whichregulate experience. Now, not to mention that with such an hypothesisit is impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment ofpredetermined aptitudes, the fact that the categories would in thiscase entirely lose that character of necessity which is essentiallyinvolved in the very conception of them, is a conclusive objection toit. The conception of cause, for example, which expresses the necessityof an effect under a presupposed condition, would be false, if itrested only upon such an arbitrary subjective necessity of unitingcertain empirical representations according to such a rule of relation.I could not then say—“The effect is connected with its cause in theobject (that is, necessarily),” but only, “I am so constituted that Ican think this representation as so connected, and not otherwise.” Nowthis is just what the sceptic wants. For in this case, all ourknowledge, depending on the supposed objective validity of ourjudgement, is nothing but mere illusion; nor would there be wantingpeople who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect tothemselves, though they must feel it. At all events, we could notdispute with any one on that which merely depends on the manner inwhich his subject is organized.Short view of the above Deduction.The foregoing deduction is an exposition of the pure conceptions of theunderstanding (and with them of all theoretical à priori cognition), asprinciples of the possibility of experience, but of experience as thedetermination of all phenomena in space and time in general—ofexperience, finally, from the principle of the original syntheticalunity of apperception, as the form of the understanding in relation totime and space as original forms of sensibility.I consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to thispoint, because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions. As we nowproceed to the exposition of the employment of these, I shall notdesignate the chapters in this manner any further.BOOK II. Analytic of PrinciplesGeneral logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly withthe division of the higher faculties of cognition. These are,understanding, judgement, and reason. This science, accordingly, treatsin its analytic of conceptions, judgements, and conclusions in exactcorrespondence with the functions and order of those mental powerswhich we include generally under the generic denomination ofunderstanding.As this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content ofcognition, whether pure or empirical, and occupies itself with the mereform of thought (discursive cognition), it must contain in its analytica canon for reason. For the form of reason has its law, which, withouttaking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition aboutwhich it is employed, can be discovered à priori, by the simpleanalysis of the action of reason into its momenta.Transcendental logic, limited as it is to a determinate content, thatof pure à priori cognitions, to wit, cannot imitate general logic inthis division. For it is evident that the transcendental employment ofreason is not objectively valid, and therefore does not belong to thelogic of truth (that is, to analytic), but as a logic of illusion,occupies a particular department in the scholastic system under thename of transcendental dialectic.Understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logica canon of objectively valid, and therefore true exercise, and arecomprehended in the analytical department of that logic. But reason, inher endeavours to arrive by à priori means at some true statementconcerning objects and to extend cognition beyond the bounds ofpossible experience, is altogether dialectic, and her illusoryassertions cannot be constructed into a canon such as an analytic oughtto contain.Accordingly, the analytic of principles will be merely a canon for thefaculty of judgement, for the instruction of this faculty in itsapplication to phenomena of the pure conceptions of the understanding,which contain the necessary condition for the establishment of à priorilaws. On this account, although the subject of the following chaptersis the especial principles of understanding, I shall make use of theterm Doctrine of the faculty of judgement, in order to define moreparticularly my present purpose.INTRODUCTION. Of the Transcendental Faculty of judgement in GeneralIf understanding in general be defined as the faculty of laws or rules,the faculty of judgement may be termed the faculty of subsumption underthese rules; that is, of distinguishing whether this or that does ordoes not stand under a given rule (casus datae legis). General logiccontains no directions or precepts for the faculty of judgement, norcan it contain any such. For as it makes abstraction of all content ofcognition, no duty is left for it, except that of exposing analyticallythe mere form of cognition in conceptions, judgements, and conclusions,and of thereby establishing formal rules for all exercise of theunderstanding. Now if this logic wished to give some general directionhow we should subsume under these rules, that is, how we shoulddistinguish whether this or that did or did not stand under them, thisagain could not be done otherwise than by means of a rule. But thisrule, precisely because it is a rule, requires for itself directionfrom the faculty of judgement. Thus, it is evident that theunderstanding is capable of being instructed by rules, but that thejudgement is a peculiar talent, which does not, and cannot requiretuition, but only exercise. This faculty is therefore the specificquality of the so-called mother wit, the want of which no scholasticdiscipline can compensate.For although education may furnish, and, as it were, engraft upon alimited understanding rules borrowed from other minds, yet the power ofemploying these rules correctly must belong to the pupil himself; andno rule which we can prescribe to him with this purpose is, in theabsence or deficiency of this gift of nature, secure from misuse.[26] Aphysician therefore, a judge or a statesman, may have in his head manyadmirable pathological, juridical, or political rules, in a degree thatmay enable him to be a profound teacher in his particular science, andyet in the application of these rules he may very possiblyblunder—either because he is wanting in natural judgement (though notin understanding) and, whilst he can comprehend the general inabstracto, cannot distinguish whether a particular case in concretoought to rank under the former; or because his faculty of judgement hasnot been sufficiently exercised by examples and real practice. Indeed,the grand and only use of examples, is to sharpen the judgement. For asregards the correctness and precision of the insight of theunderstanding, examples are commonly injurious rather than otherwise,because, as casus in terminis they seldom adequately fulfil theconditions of the rule. Besides, they often weaken the power of ourunderstanding to apprehend rules or laws in their universality,independently of particular circumstances of experience; and hence,accustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles.Examples are thus the go-cart of the judgement, which he who isnaturally deficient in that faculty cannot afford to dispense with. [26] Deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called stupidity; and for such a failing we know no remedy. A dull or narrow-minded person, to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding, may be improved by tuition, even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned. But as such persons frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement, it is not uncommon to find men extremely learned who in the application of their science betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want.But although general logic cannot give directions to the faculty ofjudgement, the case is very different as regards transcendental logic,insomuch that it appears to be the especial duty of the latter tosecure and direct, by means of determinate rules, the faculty ofjudgement in the employment of the pure understanding. For, as adoctrine, that is, as an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of theunderstanding in regard to pure à priori cognitions, philosophy isworse than useless, since from all the attempts hitherto made, littleor no ground has been gained. But, as a critique, in order to guardagainst the mistakes of the faculty of judgement (lapsus judicii) inthe employment of the few pure conceptions of the understanding whichwe possess, although its use is in this case purely negative,philosophy is called upon to apply all its acuteness and penetration.But transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity, that besidesindicating the rule, or rather the general condition for rules, whichis given in the pure conception of the understanding, it can, at thesame time, indicate à priori the case to which the rule must beapplied. The cause of the superiority which, in this respect,transcendental philosophy possesses above all other sciences exceptmathematics, lies in this: it treats of conceptions which must relate àpriori to their objects, whose objective validity consequently cannotbe demonstrated à posteriori, and is, at the same time, under theobligation of presenting in general but sufficient tests, theconditions under which objects can be given in harmony with thoseconceptions; otherwise they would be mere logical forms, withoutcontent, and not pure conceptions of the understanding.Our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will containtwo chapters. The first will treat of the sensuous condition underwhich alone pure conceptions of the understanding can be employed—thatis, of the schematism of the pure understanding. The second will treatof those synthetical judgements which are derived à priori from pureconceptions of the understanding under those conditions, and which lieà priori at the foundation of all other cognitions, that is to say, itwill treat of the principles of the pure understanding.TRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE FACULTY OF JUDGEMENT OR, ANALYTIC OFPRINCIPLESChapter I. Of the Schematism at of the Pure Conceptions of theUnderstandingIn all subsumptions of an object under a conception, the representationof the object must be homogeneous with the conception; in other words,the conception must contain that which is represented in the object tobe subsumed under it. For this is the meaning of the expression: “Anobject is contained under a conception.” Thus the empirical conceptionof a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of acircle, inasmuch as the roundness which is cogitated in the former isintuited in the latter.But pure conceptions of the understanding, when compared with empiricalintuitions, or even with sensuous intuitions in general, are quiteheterogeneous, and never can be discovered in any intuition. How thenis the subsumption of the latter under the former, and consequently theapplication of the categories to phenomena, possible?—For it isimpossible to say, for example: “Causality can be intuited through thesenses and is contained in the phenomenon.”—This natural and importantquestion forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendentaldoctrine of the faculty of judgement, with the purpose, to wit, ofshowing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied tophenomena. In all other sciences, where the conceptions by which theobject is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneousfrom those which represent the object in concreto—as it is given, it isquite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning theapplication of the former to the latter.Now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing, which on theone side is homogeneous with the category, and with the phenomenon onthe other, and so makes the application of the former to the latterpossible. This mediating representation must be pure (without anyempirical content), and yet must on the one side be intellectual, onthe other sensuous. Such a representation is the transcendental schema.The conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity ofthe manifold in general. Time, as the formal condition of the manifoldof the internal sense, consequently of the conjunction of allrepresentations, contains à priori a manifold in the pure intuition.Now a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous withthe category, which constitutes the unity thereof, that it is universaland rests upon a rule à priori. On the other hand, it is so farhomogeneous with the phenomenon, inasmuch as time is contained in everyempirical representation of the manifold. Thus an application of thecategory to phenomena becomes possible, by means of the transcendentaldetermination of time, which, as the schema of the conceptions of theunderstanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former.After what has been proved in our deduction of the categories, no one,it is to be hoped, can hesitate as to the proper decision of thequestion, whether the employment of these pure conceptions of theunderstanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental; inother words, whether the categories, as conditions of a possibleexperience, relate à priori solely to phenomena, or whether, asconditions of the possibility of things in general, their applicationcan be extended to objects as things in themselves. For we have thereseen that conceptions are quite impossible, and utterly withoutsignification, unless either to them, or at least to the elements ofwhich they consist, an object be given; and that, consequently, theycannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regardto the question whether and how these may be given to us; and, further,that the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means ofthe modification of our sensibility; and, finally, that pure à prioriconceptions, in addition to the function of the understanding in thecategory, must contain à priori formal conditions of sensibility (ofthe internal sense, namely), which again contain the general conditionunder which alone the category can be applied to any object. Thisformal and pure condition of sensibility, to which the conception ofthe understanding is restricted in its employment, we shall name theschema of the conception of the understanding, and the procedure of theunderstanding with these schemata we shall call the schematism of thepure understanding.The schema is, in itself, always a mere product of the imagination.But, as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no singleintuition, but merely unity in the determination of sensibility, theschema is clearly distinguishable from the image. Thus, if I place fivepoints one after another.... this is an image of the number five. Onthe other hand, if I only think a number in general, which may beeither five or a hundred, this thought is rather the representation ofa method of representing in an image a sum (e.g., a thousand) inconformity with a conception, than the image itself, an image which Ishould find some little difficulty in reviewing, and comparing with theconception. Now this representation of a general procedure of theimagination to present its image to a conception, I call the schema ofthis conception.In truth, it is not images of objects, but schemata, which lie at thefoundation of our pure sensuous conceptions. No image could ever beadequate to our conception of a triangle in general. For thegeneralness of the conception it never could attain to, as thisincludes under itself all triangles, whether right-angled,acute-angled, etc., whilst the image would always be limited to asingle part of this sphere. The schema of the triangle can existnowhere else than in thought, and it indicates a rule of the synthesisof the imagination in regard to pure figures in space. Still less is anobject of experience, or an image of the object, ever to the empiricalconception. On the contrary, the conception always relates immediatelyto the schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination ofour intuition, in conformity with a certain general conception. Theconception of a dog indicates a rule, according to which my imaginationcan delineate the figure of a four-footed animal in general, withoutbeing limited to any particular individual form which experiencepresents to me, or indeed to any possible image that I can represent tomyself in concreto. This schematism of our understanding in regard tophenomena and their mere form, is an art, hidden in the depths of thehuman soul, whose true modes of action we shall only with difficultydiscover and unveil. Thus much only can we say: “The image is a productof the empirical faculty of the productive imagination—the schema ofsensuous conceptions (of figures in space, for example) is a product,and, as it were, a monogram of the pure imagination à priori, wherebyand according to which images first become possible, which, however,can be connected with the conception only mediately by means of theschema which they indicate, and are in themselves never fully adequateto it.” On the other hand, the schema of a pure conception of theunderstanding is something that cannot be reduced into any image—it isnothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by the category,conformably, to a rule of unity according to conceptions. It is atranscendental product of the imagination, a product which concerns thedetermination of the internal sense, according to conditions of itsform (time) in respect to all representations, in so far as theserepresentations must be conjoined à priori in one conception,conformably to the unity of apperception.Without entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essentialrequisites of transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of theunderstanding, we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanationof them according to the order of the categories, and in connectiontherewith.For the external sense the pure image of all quantities (quantorum) isspace; the pure image of all objects of sense in general, is time. Butthe pure schema of quantity (quantitatis) as a conception of theunderstanding, is number, a representation which comprehends thesuccessive addition of one to one (homogeneous quantities). Thus,number is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifoldin a homogeneous intuition, by means of my generating time itself in myapprehension of the intuition.Reality, in the pure conception of the understanding, is that whichcorresponds to a sensation in general; that, consequently, theconception of which indicates a being (in time). Negation is that theconception of which represents a not-being (in time). The opposition ofthese two consists therefore in the difference of one and the sametime, as a time filled or a time empty. Now as time is only the form ofintuition, consequently of objects as phenomena, that which in objectscorresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects asthings in themselves (Sachheit, reality). Now every sensation has adegree or quantity by which it can fill time, that is to say, theinternal sense in respect of the representation of an object, more orless, until it vanishes into nothing (= 0 = negatio). Thus there is arelation and connection between reality and negation, or rather atransition from the former to the latter, which makes every realityrepresentable to us as a quantum; and the schema of a reality as thequantity of something in so far as it fills time, is exactly thiscontinuous and uniform generation of the reality in time, as we descendin time from the sensation which has a certain degree, down to thevanishing thereof, or gradually ascend from negation to the quantitythereof.The schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time; that is,the representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determinationof time; a substratum which therefore remains, whilst all else changes.(Time passes not, but in it passes the existence of the changeable. Totime, therefore, which is itself unchangeable and permanent,corresponds that which in the phenomenon is unchangeable in existence,that is, substance, and it is only by it that the succession andcoexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time.)The schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which,when posited, is always followed by something else. It consists,therefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as thatsuccession is subjected to a rule.The schema of community (reciprocity of action and reaction), or thereciprocal causality of substances in respect of their accidents, isthe coexistence of the determinations of the one with those of theother, according to a general rule.The schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis ofdifferent representations with the conditions of time in general (as,for example, opposites cannot exist together at the same time in thesame thing, but only after each other), and is therefore thedetermination of the representation of a thing at any time.The schema of reality is existence in a determined time.The schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time.It is clear, from all this, that the schema of the category of quantitycontains and represents the generation (synthesis) of time itself, inthe successive apprehension of an object; the schema of quality thesynthesis of sensation with the representation of time, or the fillingup of time; the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to eachother in all time (that is, according to a rule of the determination oftime): and finally, the schema of modality and its categories, timeitself, as the correlative of the determination of an object—whether itdoes belong to time, and how. The schemata, therefore, are nothing butà priori determinations of time according to rules, and these, inregard to all possible objects, following the arrangement of thecategories, relate to the series in time, the content in time, theorder in time, and finally, to the complex or totality in time.Hence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding, by meansof the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, amounts to nothingelse than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense,and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception, as a functioncorresponding to the internal sense (a receptivity). Thus, the schemataof the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and onlyconditions whereby our understanding receives an application toobjects, and consequently significance. Finally, therefore, thecategories are only capable of empirical use, inasmuch as they servemerely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis, bymeans of an à priori necessary unity (on account of the necessary unionof all consciousness in one original apperception); and so to renderthem susceptible of a complete connection in one experience. But withinthis whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions, and in theuniversal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth,which antecedes all empirical truth, and renders the latter possible.It is, however, evident at first sight, that although the schemata ofsensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories, they do,nevertheless, also restrict them, that is, they limit the categories byconditions which lie beyond the sphere of understanding—namely, insensibility. Hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon, or thesensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category. (Numerusest quantitas phaenomenon—sensatio realitas phaenomenon; constans etperdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenon—aeternitas, necessitas,phaenomena, etc.) Now, if we remove a restrictive condition, we therebyamplify, it appears, the formerly limited conception. In this way, thecategories in their pure signification, free from all conditions ofsensibility, ought to be valid of things as they are, and not, as theschemata represent them, merely as they appear; and consequently thecategories must have a significance far more extended, and whollyindependent of all schemata. In truth, there does always remain to thepure conceptions of the understanding, after abstracting every sensuouscondition, a value and significance, which is, however, merely logical.But in this case, no object is given them, and therefore they have nomeaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object. The notionof substance, for example, if we leave out the sensuous determinationof permanence, would mean nothing more than a something which can becogitated as subject, without the possibility of becoming a predicateto anything else. Of this representation I can make nothing, inasmuchas it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesseswhich must thus be valid as premier subject. Consequently, thecategories, without schemata are merely functions of the understandingfor the production of conceptions, but do not represent any object.This significance they derive from sensibility, which at the same timerealizes the understanding and restricts it.Chapter II. System of all Principles of the Pure UnderstandingIn the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the generalconditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement isjustified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding forsynthetical judgements. Our duty at present is to exhibit in systematicconnection those judgements which the understanding really produces àpriori. For this purpose, our table of the categories will certainlyafford us the natural and safe guidance. For it is precisely thecategories whose application to possible experience must constitute allpure à priori cognition of the understanding; and the relation of whichto sensibility will, on that very account, present us with a completeand systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of theuse of the understanding.Principles à priori are so called, not merely because they contain inthemselves the grounds of other judgements, but also because theythemselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions. Thispeculiarity, however, does not raise them altogether above the need ofa proof. For although there could be found no higher cognition, andtherefore no objective proof, and although such a principle ratherserves as the foundation for all cognition of the object, this by nomeans hinders us from drawing a proof from the subjective sources ofthe possibility of the cognition of an object. Such a proof isnecessary, moreover, because without it the principle might be liableto the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion.In the second place, we shall limit our investigations to thoseprinciples which relate to the categories. For as to the principles oftranscendental æsthetic, according to which space and time are theconditions of the possibility of things as phenomena, as also therestriction of these principles, namely, that they cannot be applied toobjects as things in themselves—these, of course, do not fall withinthe scope of our present inquiry. In like manner, the principles ofmathematical science form no part of this system, because they are alldrawn from intuition, and not from the pure conception of theunderstanding. The possibility of these principles, however, willnecessarily be considered here, inasmuch as they are syntheticaljudgements à priori, not indeed for the purpose of proving theiraccuracy and apodeictic certainty, which is unnecessary, but merely torender conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident à prioricognitions.But we shall have also to speak of the principle of analyticaljudgements, in opposition to synthetical judgements, which is theproper subject of our inquiries, because this very opposition will freethe theory of the latter from all ambiguity, and place it clearlybefore our eyes in its true nature.SYSTEM OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDINGSection I. Of the Supreme Principle of all Analytical JudgementsWhatever may be the content of our cognition, and in whatever mannerour cognition may be related to its object, the universal, althoughonly negative conditions of all our judgements is that they do notcontradict themselves; otherwise these judgements are in themselves(even without respect to the object) nothing. But although there mayexist no contradiction in our judgement, it may nevertheless connectconceptions in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object,or without any grounds either à priori or à posteriori for arriving atsuch a judgement, and thus, without being self-contradictory, ajudgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless.Now, the proposition: “No subject can have a predicate that contradictsit,” is called the principle of contradiction, and is a universal butpurely negative criterion of all truth. But it belongs to logic alone,because it is valid of cognitions, merely as cognitions and withoutrespect to their content, and declares that the contradiction entirelynullifies them. We can also, however, make a positive use of thisprinciple, that is, not merely to banish falsehood and error (in so faras it rests upon contradiction), but also for the cognition of truth.For if the judgement is analytical, be it affirmative or negative, itstruth must always be recognizable by means of the principle ofcontradiction. For the contrary of that which lies and is cogitated asconception in the cognition of the object will be always properlynegatived, but the conception itself must always be affirmed of theobject, inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction tothe object.We must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be theuniversal and fully sufficient Principle of all analytical cognition.But as a sufficient criterion of truth, it has no further utility orauthority. For the fact that no cognition can be at variance with thisprinciple without nullifying itself, constitutes this principle thesine qua non, but not the determining ground of the truth of ourcognition. As our business at present is properly with the syntheticalpart of our knowledge only, we shall always be on our guard not totransgress this inviolable principle; but at the same time not toexpect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truthof any synthetical proposition.There exists, however, a formula of this celebrated principle—aprinciple merely formal and entirely without content—which contains asynthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed upwith it. It is this: “It is impossible for a thing to be and not to beat the same time.” Not to mention the superfluousness of the additionof the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty, whichought to be self-evident from the proposition itself, the propositionis affected by the condition of time, and as it were says: “A thing =A, which is something = B, cannot at the same time be non-B.” But both,B as well as non-B, may quite well exist in succession. For example, aman who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man canvery well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old.Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition mustnot by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, andconsequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its truepurpose. The misunderstanding arises in this way. We first of allseparate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing, andafterwards connect with this predicate its opposite, and hence do notestablish any contradiction with the subject, but only with itspredicate, which has been conjoined with the subject synthetically—acontradiction, moreover, which obtains only when the first and secondpredicate are affirmed in the same time. If I say: “A man who isignorant is not learned,” the condition “at the same time” must beadded, for he who is at one time ignorant, may at another be learned.But if I say: “No ignorant man is a learned man,” the proposition isanalytical, because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituentpart of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negativeproposition is evident immediately from the proposition ofcontradiction, without the necessity of adding the condition “the sametime.” This is the reason why I have altered the formula of thisprinciple—an alteration which shows very clearly the nature of ananalytical proposition.Section II. Of the Supreme Principle of all Synthetical JudgementsThe explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a taskwith which general logic has nothing to do; indeed she needs not evenbe acquainted with its name. But in transcendental logic it is the mostimportant matter to be dealt with—indeed the only one, if the questionis of the possibility of synthetical judgements à priori, theconditions and extent of their validity. For when this question isfully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, thedetermination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pureunderstanding.In an analytical judgement I do not go beyond the given conception, inorder to arrive at some decision respecting it. If the judgement isaffirmative, I predicate of the conception only that which was alreadycogitated in it; if negative, I merely exclude from the conception itscontrary. But in synthetical judgements, I must go beyond the givenconception, in order to cogitate, in relation with it, something quitedifferent from that which was cogitated in it, a relation which isconsequently never one either of identity or contradiction, and bymeans of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot be discernedmerely from the judgement itself.Granted, then, that we must go out beyond a given conception, in orderto compare it synthetically with another, a third thing is necessary,in which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate. Now whatis this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all syntheticaljudgements? It is only a complex in which all our representations arecontained, the internal sense to wit, and its form à priori, time.The synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination; theirsynthetical unity (which is requisite to a judgement), upon the unityof apperception. In this, therefore, is to be sought the possibility ofsynthetical judgements, and as all three contain the sources of àpriori representations, the possibility of pure synthetical judgementsalso; nay, they are necessary upon these grounds, if we are to possessa knowledge of objects, which rests solely upon the synthesis ofrepresentations.If a cognition is to have objective reality, that is, to relate to anobject, and possess sense and meaning in respect to it, it is necessarythat the object be given in some way or another. Without this, ourconceptions are empty, and we may indeed have thought by means of them,but by such thinking we have not, in fact, cognized anything, we havemerely played with representation. To give an object, if thisexpression be understood in the sense of “to present” the object, notmediately but immediately in intuition, means nothing else than toapply the representation of it to experience, be that experience realor only possible. Space and time themselves, pure as these conceptionsare from all that is empirical, and certain as it is that they arerepresented fully à priori in the mind, would be completely withoutobjective validity, and without sense and significance, if theirnecessary use in the objects of experience were not shown. Nay, therepresentation of them is a mere schema, that always relates to thereproductive imagination, which calls up the objects of experience,without which they have no meaning. And so it is with all conceptionswithout distinction.The possibility of experience is, then, that which gives objectivereality to all our à priori cognitions. Now experience depends upon thesynthetical unity of phenomena, that is, upon a synthesis according toconceptions of the object of phenomena in general, a synthesis withoutwhich experience never could become knowledge, but would be merely arhapsody of perceptions, never fitting together into any connectedtext, according to rules of a thoroughly united (possible)consciousness, and therefore never subjected to the transcendental andnecessary unity of apperception. Experience has therefore for afoundation, à priori principles of its form, that is to say, generalrules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena, the objective reality ofwhich rules, as necessary conditions even of the possibility ofexperience can which rules, as necessary conditions—even of thepossibility of experience—can always be shown in experience. But apartfrom this relation, à priori synthetical propositions are absolutelyimpossible, because they have no third term, that is, no pure object,in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of itsconceptions.Although, then, respecting space, or the forms which productiveimagination describes therein, we do cognize much à priori insynthetical judgements, and are really in no need of experience forthis purpose, such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but abusy trifling with a mere chimera, were not space to be considered asthe condition of the phenomena which constitute the material ofexternal experience. Hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate,though but mediately, to possible experience, or rather to thepossibility of experience, and upon that alone is founded the objectivevalidity of their synthesis.While then, on the one hand, experience, as empirical synthesis, is theonly possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all othersynthesis; on the other hand, this latter synthesis, as cognition àpriori, possesses truth, that is, accordance with its object, only inso far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary to thesynthetical unity of experience.Accordingly, the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is:“Every object is subject to the necessary conditions of the syntheticalunity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.”À priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formalconditions of the à priori intuition, the synthesis of the imagination,and the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendentalapperception, to a possible cognition of experience, and say: “Theconditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the sametime conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience, andhave, for that reason, objective validity in an à priori syntheticaljudgement.”Section III. Systematic Representation of all Synthetical Principles ofthe Pure UnderstandingThat principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pureunderstanding, which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to thatwhich happens, but is even the source of principles according to whicheverything that can be presented to us as an object is necessarilysubject to rules, because without such rules we never could attain tocognition of an object. Even the laws of nature, if they arecontemplated as principles of the empirical use of the understanding,possess also a characteristic of necessity, and we may therefore atleast expect them to be determined upon grounds which are valid àpriori and antecedent to all experience. But all laws of nature,without distinction, are subject to higher principles of theunderstanding, inasmuch as the former are merely applications of thelatter to particular cases of experience. These higher principles alonetherefore give the conception, which contains the necessary condition,and, as it were, the exponent of a rule; experience, on the other hand,gives the case which comes under the rule.There is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles forprinciples of the pure understanding, or conversely; for the characterof necessity, according to conceptions which distinguish the latter,and the absence of this in every empirical proposition, how extensivelyvalid soever it may be, is a perfect safeguard against confoundingthem. There are, however, pure principles à priori, which neverthelessI should not ascribe to the pure understanding—for this reason, thatthey are not derived from pure conceptions, but (although by themediation of the understanding) from pure intuitions. But understandingis the faculty of conceptions. Such principles mathematical sciencepossesses, but their application to experience, consequently theirobjective validity, nay the possibility of such à priori syntheticalcognitions (the deduction thereof) rests entirely upon the pureunderstanding.On this account, I shall not reckon among my principles those ofmathematics; though I shall include those upon the possibility andobjective validity à priori, of principles of the mathematical science,which, consequently, are to be looked upon as the principle of these,and which proceed from conceptions to intuition, and not from intuitionto conceptions.In the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding topossible experience, the employment of their synthesis is eithermathematical or dynamical, for it is directed partly on the intuitionalone, partly on the existence of a phenomenon. But the à prioriconditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experienceabsolutely necessary, those of the existence of objects of a possibleempirical intuition are in themselves contingent. Hence the principlesof the mathematical use of the categories will possess a character ofabsolute necessity, that is, will be apodeictic; those, on the otherhand, of the dynamical use, the character of an à priori necessityindeed, but only under the condition of empirical thought in anexperience, therefore only mediately and indirectly. Consequently theywill not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to theformer, although their application to experience does not, for thatreason, lose its truth and certitude. But of this point we shall bebetter able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principles.The table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table ofprinciples, because these are nothing else than rules for the objectiveemployment of the former. Accordingly, all principles of the pureunderstanding are:                                1                              Axioms                           of Intuition               2                                    3          Anticipations                          Analogies          of Perception                        of Experience                                4                          Postulates of                        Empirical Thought                           in generalThese appellations I have chosen advisedly, in order that we might notlose sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and theemployment of these principles. It will, however, soon appear that—afact which concerns both the evidence of these principles, and the àpriori determination of phenomena—according to the categories ofquantity and quality (if we attend merely to the form of these), theprinciples of these categories are distinguishable from those of thetwo others, in as much as the former are possessed of an intuitive, butthe latter of a merely discursive, though in both instances a complete,certitude. I shall therefore call the former mathematical, and thelatter dynamical principles.[27] It must be observed, however, that bythese terms I mean just as little in the one case the principles ofmathematics as those of general (physical) dynamics in the other. Ihave here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding, intheir application to the internal sense (without distinction of therepresentations given therein), by means of which the sciences ofmathematics and dynamics become possible. Accordingly, I have namedthese principles rather with reference to their application than theircontent; and I shall now proceed to consider them in the order in whichthey stand in the table. [27] All combination (conjunctio) is either composition (compositio) or connection (nexus). The former is the synthesis of a manifold, the parts of which do not necessarily belong to each other. For example, the two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal, do not necessarily belong to each other, and of this kind is the synthesis of the homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered. This synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition, the former of which is applied to extensive, the latter to intensive quantities. The second sort of combination (nexus) is the synthesis of a manifold, in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each other; for example, the accident to a substance, or the effect to the cause. Consequently it is a synthesis of that which though heterogeneous, is represented as connected à priori. This combination—not an arbitrary one—I entitle dynamical because it concerns the connection of the existence of the manifold. This, again, may be divided into the physical synthesis, of the phenomena divided among each other, and the metaphysical synthesis, or the connection of phenomena à priori in the faculty of cognition.1. AXIOMS OF INTUITION.The principle of these is: All Intuitions are Extensive Quantities.PROOF.All phenomena contain, as regards their form, an intuition in space andtime, which lies à priori at the foundation of all without exception.Phenomena, therefore, cannot be apprehended, that is, received intoempirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of amanifold, through which the representations of a determinate space ortime are generated; that is to say, through the composition of thehomogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of thismanifold (homogeneous). Now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifoldin intuition, in so far as thereby the representation of an object isrendered possible, is the conception of a quantity (quanti).Consequently, even the perception of an object as phenomenon ispossible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of thegiven sensuous intuition, through which the unity of the composition ofthe homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated;that is to say, all phenomena are quantities, and extensive quantities,because as intuitions in space or time they must be represented bymeans of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves aredetermined.An extensive quantity I call that wherein the representation of theparts renders possible (and therefore necessarily antecedes) therepresentation of the whole. I cannot represent to myself any line,however small, without drawing it in thought, that is, withoutgenerating from a point all its parts one after another, and in thisway alone producing this intuition. Precisely the same is the case withevery, even the smallest, portion of time. I cogitate therein only thesuccessive progress from one moment to another, and hence, by means ofthe different portions of time and the addition of them, a determinatequantity of time is produced. As the pure intuition in all phenomena iseither time or space, so is every phenomenon in its character ofintuition an extensive quantity, inasmuch as it can only be cognized inour apprehension by successive synthesis (from part to part). Allphenomena are, accordingly, to be considered as aggregates, that is, asa collection of previously given parts; which is not the case withevery sort of quantities, but only with those which are represented andapprehended by us as extensive.On this successive synthesis of the productive imagination, in thegeneration of figures, is founded the mathematics of extension, orgeometry, with its axioms, which express the conditions of sensuousintuition à priori, under which alone the schema of a pure conceptionof external intuition can exist; for example, “be tween two points onlyone straight line is possible,” “two straight lines cannot enclose aspace,” etc. These are the axioms which properly relate only toquantities (quanta) as such.But, as regards the quantity of a thing (quantitas), that is to say,the answer to the question: “How large is this or that object?”although, in respect to this question, we have various propositionssynthetical and immediately certain (indemonstrabilia); we have, in theproper sense of the term, no axioms. For example, the propositions: “Ifequals be added to equals, the wholes are equal”; “If equals be takenfrom equals, the remainders are equal”; are analytical, because I amimmediately conscious of the identity of the production of the onequantity with the production of the other; whereas axioms must be àpriori synthetical propositions. On the other hand, the self-evidentpropositions as to the relation of numbers, are certainly syntheticalbut not universal, like those of geometry, and for this reason cannotbe called axioms, but numerical formulae. That 7 + 5 = 12 is not ananalytical proposition. For neither in the representation of seven, norof five, nor of the composition of the two numbers, do I cogitate thenumber twelve. (Whether I cogitate the number in the addition of both,is not at present the question; for in the case of an analyticalproposition, the only point is whether I really cogitate the predicatein the representation of the subject.) But although the proposition issynthetical, it is nevertheless only a singular proposition. In so faras regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous (theunits), it cannot take place except in one manner, although our use ofthese numbers is afterwards general. If I say: “A triangle can beconstructed with three lines, any two of which taken together aregreater than the third,” I exercise merely the pure function of theproductive imagination, which may draw the lines longer or shorter andconstruct the angles at its pleasure. On the contrary, the number sevenis possible only in one manner, and so is likewise the number twelve,which results from the synthesis of seven and five. Such propositions,then, cannot be termed axioms (for in that case we should have aninfinity of these), but numerical formulae.This transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatlyenlarges our à priori cognition. For it is by this principle alone thatpure mathematics is rendered applicable in all its precision to objectsof experience, and without it the validity of this application wouldnot be so self-evident; on the contrary, contradictions and confusionshave often arisen on this very point. Phenomena are not things inthemselves. Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition(of space and time); consequently, what geometry affirms of the latter,is indisputably valid of the former. All evasions, such as thestatement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules ofconstruction in space (for example, to the rule of the infinitedivisibility of lines or angles), must fall to the ground. For, ifthese objections hold good, we deny to space, and with it to allmathematics, objective validity, and no longer know wherefore, and howfar, mathematics can be applied to phenomena. The synthesis of spacesand times as the essential form of all intuition, is that which renderspossible the apprehension of a phenomenon, and therefore every externalexperience, consequently all cognition of the objects of experience;and whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former, mustnecessarily hold good of the latter. All objections are but thechicaneries of an ill-instructed reason, which erroneously thinks toliberate the objects of sense from the formal conditions of oursensibility, and represents these, although mere phenomena, as thingsin themselves, presented as such to our understanding. But in thiscase, no à priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible,consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the sciencewhich determines these conceptions, that is to say, geometry, woulditself be impossible.2. ANTICIPATIONS OF PERCEPTION.The principle of these is: In all phenomena the Real, that which is anobject of sensation, has Intensive Quantity, that is, has a Degree.PROOF.Perception is empirical consciousness, that is to say, a consciousnesswhich contains an element of sensation. Phenomena as objects ofperception are not pure, that is, merely formal intuitions, like spaceand time, for they cannot be perceived in themselves.[28] They contain,then, over and above the intuition, the materials for an object(through which is represented something existing in space or time),that is to say, they contain the real of sensation, as a representationmerely subjective, which gives us merely the consciousness that thesubject is affected, and which we refer to some external object. Now, agradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousnessis possible, inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirelyvanishes, and there remains a merely formal consciousness (à priori) ofthe manifold in time and space; consequently there is possible asynthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation fromits commencement, that is, from the pure intuition = 0 onwards up to acertain quantity of the sensation. Now as sensation in itself is not anobjective representation, and in it is to be found neither theintuition of space nor of time, it cannot possess any extensivequantity, and yet there does belong to it a quantity (and that by meansof its apprehension, in which empirical consciousness can within acertain time rise from nothing = 0 up to its given amount),consequently an intensive quantity. And thus we must ascribe intensivequantity, that is, a degree of influence on sense to all objects ofperception, in so far as this perception contains sensation. [28] They can be perceived only as phenomena, and some part of them must always belong to the non-ego; whereas pure intuitions are entirely the products of the mind itself, and as such are cognized _in themselves.—Tr_All cognition, by means of which I am enabled to cognize and determineà priori what belongs to empirical cognition, may be called ananticipation; and without doubt this is the sense in which Epicurusemployed his expression prholepsis. But as there is in phenomenasomething which is never cognized à priori, which on this accountconstitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition,that is to say, sensation (as the matter of perception), it follows,that sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at allanticipated. On the other hand, we might very well term the puredeterminations in space and time, as well in regard to figure as toquantity, anticipations of phenomena, because they represent à priorithat which may always be given à posteriori in experience. But supposethat in every sensation, as sensation in general, without anyparticular sensation being thought of, there existed something whichcould be cognized à priori, this would deserve to be calledanticipation in a special sense—special, because it may seem surprisingto forestall experience, in that which concerns the matter ofexperience, and which we can only derive from itself. Yet such reallyis the case here.Apprehension[29], by means of sensation alone, fills only one moment,that is, if I do not take into consideration a succession of manysensations. As that in the phenomenon, the apprehension of which is nota successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entirerepresentation, sensation has therefore no extensive quantity; the wantof sensation in a moment of time would represent it as empty,consequently = 0. That which in the empirical intuition corresponds tosensation is reality (realitas phaenomenon); that which corresponds tothe absence of it, negation = 0. Now every sensation is capable of adiminution, so that it can decrease, and thus gradually disappear.Therefore, between reality in a phenomenon and negation, there exists acontinuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations, thedifference of which from each other is always smaller than that betweenthe given sensation and zero, or complete negation. That is to say, thereal in a phenomenon has always a quantity, which however is notdiscoverable in apprehension, inasmuch as apprehension take place bymeans of mere sensation in one instant, and not by the successivesynthesis of many sensations, and therefore does not progress fromparts to the whole. Consequently, it has a quantity, but not anextensive quantity. [29] Apprehension is the Kantian word for preception, in the largest sense in which we employ that term. It is the genus which includes under i, as species, perception proper and sensation proper—TrNow that quantity which is apprehended only as unity, and in whichplurality can be represented only by approximation to negation = O, Iterm intensive quantity. Consequently, reality in a phenomenon hasintensive quantity, that is, a degree. If we consider this reality ascause (be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon, forexample, a change), we call the degree of reality in its character ofcause a momentum, for example, the momentum of weight; and for thisreason, that the degree only indicates that quantity the apprehensionof which is not successive, but instantaneous. This, however, I touchupon only in passing, for with causality I have at present nothing todo.Accordingly, every sensation, consequently every reality in phenomena,however small it may be, has a degree, that is, an intensive quantity,which may always be lessened, and between reality and negation thereexists a continuous connection of possible realities, and possiblesmaller perceptions. Every colour—for example, red—has a degree, which,be it ever so small, is never the smallest, and so is it always withheat, the momentum of weight, etc.This property of quantities, according to which no part of them is thesmallest possible (no part simple), is called their continuity. Spaceand time are quanta continua, because no part of them can be given,without enclosing it within boundaries (points and moments),consequently, this given part is itself a space or a time. Space,therefore, consists only of spaces, and time of times. Points andmoments are only boundaries, that is, the mere places or positions oftheir limitation. But places always presuppose intuitions which are tolimit or determine them; and we cannot conceive either space or timecomposed of constituent parts which are given before space or time.Such quantities may also be called flowing, because synthesis (of theproductive imagination) in the production of these quantities is aprogression in time, the continuity of which we are accustomed toindicate by the expression flowing.All phenomena, then, are continuous quantities, in respect both tointuition and mere perception (sensation, and with it reality). In theformer case they are extensive quantities; in the latter, intensive.When the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted,there results merely an aggregate of several phenomena, and notproperly a phenomenon as a quantity, which is not produced by the merecontinuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind, but by therepetition of a synthesis always ceasing. For example, if I callthirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money, I employ the term quitecorrectly, inasmuch as I understand by thirteen dollars the value of amark in standard silver, which is, to be sure, a continuous quantity,in which no part is the smallest, but every part might constitute apiece of money, which would contain material for still smaller pieces.If, however, by the words thirteen dollars I understand so many coins(be their value in silver what it may), it would be quite erroneous touse the expression a quantity of dollars; on the contrary, I must callthem aggregate, that is, a number of coins. And as in every number wemust have unity as the foundation, so a phenomenon taken as unity is aquantity, and as such always a continuous quantity (quantum continuum).Now, seeing all phenomena, whether considered as extensive orintensive, are continuous quantities, the proposition: “All change(transition of a thing from one state into another) is continuous,”might be proved here easily, and with mathematical evidence, were itnot that the causality of a change lies, entirely beyond the bounds ofa transcendental philosophy, and presupposes empirical principles. Forof the possibility of a cause which changes the condition of things,that is, which determines them to the contrary to a certain givenstate, the understanding gives us à priori no knowledge; not merelybecause it has no insight into the possibility of it (for such insightis absent in several à priori cognitions), but because the notion ofchange concerns only certain determinations of phenomena, whichexperience alone can acquaint us with, while their cause lies in theunchangeable. But seeing that we have nothing which we could hereemploy but the pure fundamental conceptions of all possible experience,among which of course nothing empirical can be admitted, we dare not,without injuring the unity of our system, anticipate general physicalscience, which is built upon certain fundamental experiences.Nevertheless, we are in no want of proofs of the great influence whichthe principle above developed exercises in the anticipation ofperceptions, and even in supplying the want of them, so far as toshield us against the false conclusions which otherwise we might rashlydraw.If all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negationthere is an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees, and if,nevertheless, every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivityfor sensations; no perception, and consequently no experience ispossible, which can prove, either immediately or mediately, an entireabsence of all reality in a phenomenon; in other words, it isimpossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence ofempty space or of empty time. For in the first place, an entire absenceof reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object ofperception; secondly, such absence cannot be deduced from thecontemplation of any single phenomenon, and the difference of thedegrees in its reality; nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanationof any phenomenon. For if even the complete intuition of a determinatespace or time is thoroughly real, that is, if no part thereof is empty,yet because every reality has its degree, which, with the extensivequantity of the phenomenon unchanged, can diminish through endlessgradations down to nothing (the void), there must be infinitelygraduated degrees, with which space or time is filled, and theintensive quantity in different phenomena may be smaller or greater,although the extensive quantity of the intuition remains equal andunaltered.We shall give an example of this. Almost all natural philosophers,remarking a great difference in the quantity of the matter of differentkinds in bodies with the same volume (partly on account of the momentumof gravity or weight, partly on account of the momentum of resistanceto other bodies in motion), conclude unanimously that this volume(extensive quantity of the phenomenon) must be void in all bodies,although in different proportion. But who would suspect that these forthe most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into nature shouldground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesis—a sort ofhypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid? Yet this they do,in assuming that the real in space (I must not here call itimpenetrability or weight, because these are empirical conceptions) isalways identical, and can only be distinguished according to itsextensive quantity, that is, multiplicity. Now to this presupposition,for which they can have no ground in experience, and which consequentlyis merely metaphysical, I oppose a transcendental demonstration, whichit is true will not explain the difference in the filling up of spaces,but which nevertheless completely does away with the supposed necessityof the above-mentioned presupposition that we cannot explain the saiddifference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty spaces. Thisdemonstration, moreover, has the merit of setting the understanding atliberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner, if theexplanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis. For we perceivethat although two equal spaces may be completely filled by mattersaltogether different, so that in neither of them is there left a singlepoint wherein matter is not present, nevertheless, every reality hasits degree (of resistance or of weight), which, without diminution ofthe extensive quantity, can become less and less ad infinitum, beforeit passes into nothingness and disappears. Thus an expansion whichfills a space—for example, caloric, or any other reality in thephenomenal world—can decrease in its degrees to infinity, yet withoutleaving the smallest part of the space empty; on the contrary, fillingit with those lesser degrees as completely as another phenomenon couldwith greater. My intention here is by no means to maintain that this isreally the case with the difference of matters, in regard to theirspecific gravity; I wish only to prove, from a principle of the pureunderstanding, that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode ofexplanation possible, and that it is erroneous to regard the real in aphenomenon as equal quoad its degree, and different only quoad itsaggregation and extensive quantity, and this, too, on the pretendedauthority of an à priori principle of the understanding.Nevertheless, this principle of the anticipation of perception mustsomewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendentalphilosophy has rendered cautious. We must naturally entertain somedoubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such syntheticalproposition as that respecting the degree of all reality in phenomena,and consequently the possibility of the internal difference ofsensation itself—abstraction being made of its empirical quality. Thusit is a question not unworthy of solution: “How the understanding canpronounce synthetically and à priori respecting phenomena, and thusanticipate these, even in that which is peculiarly and merelyempirical, that, namely, which concerns sensation itself?”The quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical, and cannotbe represented à priori (for example, colours, taste, etc.). But thereal—that which corresponds to sensation—in opposition to negation = 0,only represents something the conception of which in itself contains abeing (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in anempirical consciousness. That is to say, the empirical consciousness inthe internal sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree, so thatthe very same extensive quantity of intuition, an illuminated surface,for example, excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many othersurfaces less illuminated. We can therefore make complete abstractionof the extensive quantity of a phenomenon, and represent to ourselvesin the mere sensation in a certain momentum, a synthesis of homogeneousascension from 0 up to the given empirical consciousness, Allsensations therefore as such are given only à posteriori, but thisproperty thereof, namely, that they have a degree, can be known àpriori. It is worthy of remark, that in respect to quantities ingeneral, we can cognize à priori only a single quality, namely,continuity; but in respect to all quality (the real in phenomena), wecannot cognize à priori anything more than the intensive quantitythereof, namely, that they have a degree. All else is left toexperience.3. ANALOGIES OF EXPERIENCE.The principle of these is: Experience is possible only through therepresentation of a necessary connection of Perceptions.PROOF.Experience is an empirical cognition; that is to say, a cognition whichdetermines an object by means of perceptions. It is therefore asynthesis of perceptions, a synthesis which is not itself contained inperception, but which contains the synthetical unity of the manifold ofperception in a consciousness; and this unity constitutes the essentialof our cognition of objects of the senses, that is, of experience (notmerely of intuition or sensation). Now in experience our perceptionscome together contingently, so that no character of necessity in theirconnection appears, or can appear from the perceptions themselves,because apprehension is only a placing together of the manifold ofempirical intuition, and no representation of a necessity in theconnected existence of the phenomena which apprehension bringstogether, is to be discovered therein. But as experience is a cognitionof objects by means of perceptions, it follows that the relation of theexistence of the existence of the manifold must be represented inexperience not as it is put together in time, but as it is objectivelyin time. And as time itself cannot be perceived, the determination ofthe existence of objects in time can only take place by means of theirconnection in time in general, consequently only by means of à prioriconnecting conceptions. Now as these conceptions always possess thecharacter of necessity, experience is possible only by means of arepresentation of the necessary connection of perception.The three modi of time are permanence, succession, and coexistence.Accordingly, there are three rules of all relations of time inphenomena, according to which the existence of every phenomenon isdetermined in respect of the unity of all time, and these antecede allexperience and render it possible.The general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessaryunity of apperception in relation to all possible empiricalconsciousness (perception) at every time, consequently, as this unitylies à priori at the foundation of all mental operations, the principlerests on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to theirrelation in time. For the original apperception relates to our internalsense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates à priorito its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empiricalconsciousness in time. Now this manifold must be combined in originalapperception according to relations of time—a necessity imposed by theà priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjectedall that can belong to my (i.e., my own) cognition, and therefore allthat can become an object for me. This synthetical and à prioridetermined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore therule: “All empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules ofthe general determination of time”; and the analogies of experience, ofwhich we are now about to treat, must be rules of this nature.These principles have this peculiarity, that they do not concernphenomena, and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof, butmerely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other inregard to this existence. Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing ina phenomenon can be determined à priori in such a manner that the ruleof its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this à prioriintuition in every empirical example. But the existence of phenomenacannot be known à priori, and although we could arrive by this path ata conclusion of the fact of some existence, we could not cognize thatexistence determinately, that is to say, we should be incapable ofanticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would bedistinguishable from that of others.The two principles above mentioned, which I called mathematical, inconsideration of the fact of their authorizing the application ofmathematic phenomena, relate to these phenomena only in regard to theirpossibility, and instruct us how phenomena, as far as regards theirintuition or the real in their perception, can be generated accordingto the rules of a mathematical synthesis. Consequently, numericalquantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as aquantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other.Thus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I mightcompose and give à priori, that is construct, the degree of oursensations of the sun-light.[30] We may therefore entitle these twoprinciples constitutive. [30] Kant’s meaning is: The two principles enunciated under the heads of “Axioms of Intuition,” and “Anticipations of Perception,” authorize the application to phenomena of determinations of size and number, that is of mathematic. For example, I may compute the light of the sun, and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater than that of the moon. In the same way, heat is measured by the comparison of its different effects on water, &c., and on mercury in a thermometer.—TrThe case is very different with those principles whose province it isto subject the existence of phenomena to rules à priori. For asexistence does not admit of being constructed, it is clear that theymust only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulativeprinciples. In this case, therefore, neither axioms nor anticipationsare to be thought of. Thus, if a perception is given us, in a certainrelation of time to other (although undetermined) perceptions, wecannot then say à priori, what and how great (in quantity) the otherperception necessarily connected with the former is, but only how it isconnected, quoad its existence, in this given modus of time. Analogiesin philosophy mean something very different from that which theyrepresent in mathematics. In the latter they are formulae, whichenounce the equality of two relations of quantity, and are alwaysconstitutive, so that if two terms of the proportion are given, thethird is also given, that is, can be constructed by the aid of theseformulae. But in philosophy, analogy is not the equality of twoquantitative but of two qualitative relations. In this case, from threegiven terms, I can give à priori and cognize the relation to a fourthmember, but not this fourth term itself, although I certainly possess arule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience, anda mark to assist me in discovering it. An analogy of experience istherefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must ariseout of perceptions in respect to objects (phenomena) not as aconstitutive, but merely as a regulative principle. The same holds goodalso of the postulates of empirical thought in general, which relate tothe synthesis of mere intuition (which concerns the form of phenomena),the synthesis of perception (which concerns the matter of phenomena),and the synthesis of experience (which concerns the relation of theseperceptions). For they are only regulative principles, and clearlydistinguishable from the mathematical, which are constitutive, notindeed in regard to the certainty which both possess à priori, but inthe mode of evidence thereof, consequently also in the manner ofdemonstration.But what has been observed of all synthetical propositions, and must beparticularly remarked in this place, is this, that these analogiespossess significance and validity, not as principles of thetranscendental, but only as principles of the empirical use of theunderstanding, and their truth can therefore be proved only as such,and that consequently the phenomena must not be subjoined directlyunder the categories, but only under their schemata. For if the objectsto which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, itwould be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning themsynthetically à priori. But they are nothing but phenomena; a completeknowledge of which—a knowledge to which all principles à priori must atlast relate—is the only possible experience. It follows that theseprinciples can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions ofthe empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena. Butthis synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conceptionof the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis ingeneral, the category contains the function unrestricted by anysensuous condition. These principles will therefore authorize us toconnect phenomena according to an analogy, with the logical anduniversal unity of conceptions, and consequently to employ thecategories in the principles themselves; but in the application of themto experience, we shall use only their schemata, as the key to theirproper application, instead of the categories, or rather the latter asrestricting conditions, under the title of “formulae” of the former.A. FIRST ANALOGY.Principle of the Permanence of Substance.In all changes of phenomena, substance is permanent, and the quantumthereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished.PROOF.All phenomena exist in time, wherein alone as substratum, that is, asthe permanent form of the internal intuition, coexistence andsuccession can be represented. Consequently time, in which all changesof phenomena must be cogitated, remains and changes not, because it isthat in which succession and coexistence can be represented only asdeterminations thereof. Now, time in itself cannot be an object ofperception. It follows that in objects of perception, that is, inphenomena, there must be found a substratum which represents time ingeneral, and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived bymeans of the relation of phenomena to it. But the substratum of allreality, that is, of all that pertains to the existence of things, issubstance; all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as adetermination of substance. Consequently, the permanent, in relation towhich alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined, issubstance in the world of phenomena, that is, the real in phenomena,that which, as the substratum of all change, remains ever the same.Accordingly, as this cannot change in existence, its quantity in naturecan neither be increased nor diminished.Our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive,is Consequently always changing. By it alone we could, therefore, neverdetermine whether this manifold, as an object of experience, iscoexistent or successive, unless it had for a foundation somethingfixed and permanent, of the existence of which all succession andcoexistence are nothing but so many modes (modi of time). Only in thepermanent, then, are relations of time possible (for simultaneity andsuccession are the only relations in time); that is to say, thepermanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of timeitself, in which alone all determination of time is possible.Permanence is, in fact, just another expression for time, as theabiding correlate of all existence of phenomena, and of all change, andof all coexistence. For change does not affect time itself, but onlythe phenomena in time (just as coexistence cannot be regarded as amodus of time itself, seeing that in time no parts are coexistent, butall successive). If we were to attribute succession to time itself, weshould be obliged to cogitate another time, in which this successionwould be possible. It is only by means of the permanent that existencein different parts of the successive series of time receives aquantity, which we entitle duration. For in mere succession, existenceis perpetually vanishing and recommencing, and therefore never has eventhe least quantity. Without the permanent, then, no relation in time ispossible. Now, time in itself is not an object of perception;consequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded as thesubstratum of all determination of time, and consequently also as thecondition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions,that is, of experience; and all existence and all change in time canonly be regarded as a mode in the existence of that which abidesunchangeably. Therefore, in all phenomena, the permanent is the objectin itself, that is, the substance (phenomenon); but all that changes orcan change belongs only to the mode of the existence of this substanceor substances, consequently to its determinations.I find that in all ages not only the philosopher, but even the commonunderstanding, has preposited this permanence as a substratum of allchange in phenomena; indeed, I am compelled to believe that they willalways accept this as an indubitable fact. Only the philosopherexpresses himself in a more precise and definite manner, when he says:“In all changes in the world, the substance remains, and the accidentsalone are changeable.” But of this decidedly synthetical proposition, Inowhere meet with even an attempt at proof; nay, it very rarely has thegood fortune to stand, as it deserves to do, at the head of the pureand entirely à priori laws of nature. In truth, the statement thatsubstance is permanent, is tautological. For this very permanence isthe ground on which we apply the category of substance to thephenomenon; and we should have been obliged to prove that in allphenomena there is something permanent, of the existence of which thechangeable is nothing but a determination. But because a proof of thisnature cannot be dogmatical, that is, cannot be drawn from conceptions,inasmuch as it concerns a synthetical proposition à priori, and asphilosophers never reflected that such propositions are valid only inrelation to possible experience, and therefore cannot be proved exceptby means of a deduction of the possibility of experience, it is nowonder that while it has served as the foundation of all experience(for we feel the need of it in empirical cognition), it has never beensupported by proof.A philosopher was asked: “What is the weight of smoke?” He answered:“Subtract from the weight of the burnt wood the weight of the remainingashes, and you will have the weight of the smoke.” Thus he presumed itto be incontrovertible that even in fire the matter (substance) doesnot perish, but that only the form of it undergoes a change. In likemanner was the saying: “From nothing comes nothing,” only anotherinference from the principle or permanence, or rather of theever-abiding existence of the true subject in phenomena. For if that inthe phenomenon which we call substance is to be the proper substratumof all determination of time, it follows that all existence in past aswell as in future time, must be determinable by means of it alone.Hence we are entitled to apply the term substance to a phenomenon, onlybecause we suppose its existence in all time, a notion which the wordpermanence does not fully express, as it seems rather to be referableto future time. However, the internal necessity perpetually to be, isinseparably connected with the necessity always to have been, and sothe expression may stand as it is. “Gigni de nihilo nihil; in nihilumnil posse reverti,”[31] are two propositions which the ancients neverparted, and which people nowadays sometimes mistakenly disjoin, becausethey imagine that the propositions apply to objects as things inthemselves, and that the former might be inimical to the dependence(even in respect of its substance also) of the world upon a supremecause. But this apprehension is entirely needless, for the question inthis case is only of phenomena in the sphere of experience, the unityof which never could be possible, if we admitted the possibility thatnew things (in respect of their substance) should arise. For in thatcase, we should lose altogether that which alone can represent theunity of time, to wit, the identity of the substratum, as that throughwhich alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity. Thispermanence is, however, nothing but the manner in which we represent toourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world. [31] Persius, Satirae, iii.83-84.The determinations of a substance, which are only particular modes ofits existence, are called accidents. They are always real, because theyconcern the existence of substance (negations are only determinations,which express the non-existence of something in the substance). Now, ifto this real in the substance we ascribe a particular existence (forexample, to motion as an accident of matter), this existence is calledinherence, in contradistinction to the existence of substance, which wecall subsistence. But hence arise many misconceptions, and it would bea more accurate and just mode of expression to designate the accidentonly as the mode in which the existence of a substance is positivelydetermined. Meanwhile, by reason of the conditions of the logicalexercise of our understanding, it is impossible to avoid separating, asit were, that which in the existence of a substance is subject tochange, whilst the substance remains, and regarding it in relation tothat which is properly permanent and radical. On this account, thiscategory of substance stands under the title of relation, ratherbecause it is the condition thereof than because it contains in itselfany relation.Now, upon this notion of permanence rests the proper notion of theconception change. Origin and extinction are not changes of that whichoriginates or becomes extinct. Change is but a mode of existence, whichfollows on another mode of existence of the same object; hence all thatchanges is permanent, and only the condition thereof changes. Now sincethis mutation affects only determinations, which can have a beginningor an end, we may say, employing an expression which seems somewhatparadoxical: “Only the permanent (substance) is subject to change; themutable suffers no change, but rather alternation, that is, whencertain determinations cease, others begin.”Change, when, cannot be perceived by us except in substances, andorigin or extinction in an absolute sense, that does not concern merelya determination of the permanent, cannot be a possible perception, forit is this very notion of the permanent which renders possible therepresentation of a transition from one state into another, and fromnon-being to being, which, consequently, can be empirically cognizedonly as alternating determinations of that which is permanent. Grantthat a thing absolutely begins to be; we must then have a point of timein which it was not. But how and by what can we fix and determine thispoint of time, unless by that which already exists? For a voidtime—preceding—is not an object of perception; but if we connect thisbeginning with objects which existed previously, and which continue toexist till the object in question in question begins to be, then thelatter can only be a determination of the former as the permanent. Thesame holds good of the notion of extinction, for this presupposes theempirical representation of a time, in which a phenomenon no longerexists.Substances (in the world of phenomena) are the substratum of alldeterminations of time. The beginning of some, and the ceasing to be ofother substances, would utterly do away with the only condition of theempirical unity of time; and in that case phenomena would relate to twodifferent times, in which, side by side, existence would pass; which isabsurd. For there is only one time in which all different times must beplaced, not as coexistent, but as successive.Accordingly, permanence is a necessary condition under which alonephenomena, as things or objects, are determinable in a possibleexperience. But as regards the empirical criterion of this necessarypermanence, and with it of the substantiality of phenomena, we shallfind sufficient opportunity to speak in the sequel.B. SECOND ANALOGY.Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality.All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Causeand Effect.PROOF.(That all phenomena in the succession of time are only changes, thatis, a successive being and non-being of the determinations ofsubstance, which is permanent; consequently that a being of substanceitself which follows on the non-being thereof, or a non-being ofsubstance which follows on the being thereof, in other words, that theorigin or extinction of substance itself, is impossible—all this hasbeen fully established in treating of the foregoing principle. Thisprinciple might have been expressed as follows: “All alteration(succession) of phenomena is merely change”; for the changes ofsubstance are not origin or extinction, because the conception ofchange presupposes the same subject as existing with two oppositedeterminations, and consequently as permanent. After this premonition,we shall proceed to the proof.)I perceive that phenomena succeed one another, that is to say, a stateof things exists at one time, the opposite of which existed in a formerstate. In this case, then, I really connect together two perceptions intime. Now connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition,but is the product of a synthetical faculty of imagination, whichdetermines the internal sense in respect of a relation of time. Butimagination can connect these two states in two ways, so that eitherthe one or the other may antecede in time; for time in itself cannot bean object of perception, and what in an object precedes and whatfollows cannot be empirically determined in relation to it. I am onlyconscious, then, that my imagination places one state before and theother after; not that the one state antecedes the other in the object.In other words, the objective relation of the successive phenomenaremains quite undetermined by means of mere perception. Now in orderthat this relation may be cognized as determined, the relation betweenthe two states must be so cogitated that it is thereby determined asnecessary, which of them must be placed before and which after, and notconversely. But the conception which carries with it a necessity ofsynthetical unity, can be none other than a pure conception of theunderstanding which does not lie in mere perception; and in this caseit is the conception of “the relation of cause and effect,” the formerof which determines the latter in time, as its necessary consequence,and not as something which might possibly antecede (or which might insome cases not be perceived to follow). It follows that it is onlybecause we subject the sequence of phenomena, and consequently allchange, to the law of causality, that experience itself, that is,empirical cognition of phenomena, becomes possible; and consequently,that phenomena themselves, as objects of experience, are possible onlyby virtue of this law.Our apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive. Therepresentations of parts succeed one another. Whether they succeed oneanother in the object also, is a second point for reflection, which wasnot contained in the former. Now we may certainly give the name ofobject to everything, even to every representation, so far as we areconscious thereof; but what this word may mean in the case ofphenomena, not merely in so far as they (as representations) areobjects, but only in so far as they indicate an object, is a questionrequiring deeper consideration. In so far as they, regarded merely asrepresentations, are at the same time objects of consciousness, theyare not to be distinguished from apprehension, that is, reception intothe synthesis of imagination, and we must therefore say: “The manifoldof phenomena is always produced successively in the mind.” If phenomenawere things in themselves, no man would be able to conjecture from thesuccession of our representations how this manifold is connected in theobject; for we have to do only with our representations. How things maybe in themselves, without regard to the representations through whichthey affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition. Nowalthough phenomena are not things in themselves, and are neverthelessthe only thing given to us to be cognized, it is my duty to show whatsort of connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomenathemselves, while the representation of this manifold in apprehensionis always successive. For example, the apprehension of the manifold inthe phenomenon of a house which stands before me, is successive. Nowcomes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itselfsuccessive—which no one will be at all willing to grant. But, so soonas I raise my conception of an object to the transcendentalsignification thereof, I find that the house is not a thing in itself,but only a phenomenon, that is, a representation, the transcendentalobject of which remains utterly unknown. What then am I to understandby the question: “How can the manifold be connected in the phenomenonitself—not considered as a thing in itself, but merely as aphenomenon?” Here that which lies in my successive apprehension isregarded as representation, whilst the phenomenon which is given me,notwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of theserepresentations, is regarded as the object thereof, with which myconception, drawn from the representations of apprehension, mustharmonize. It is very soon seen that, as accordance of the cognitionwith its object constitutes truth, the question now before us can onlyrelate to the formal conditions of empirical truth; and that thephenomenon, in opposition to the representations of apprehension, canonly be distinguished therefrom as the object of them, if it is subjectto a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension, andwhich renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold. That inthe phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule ofapprehension, is the object.Let us now proceed to our task. That something happens, that is to say,that something or some state exists which before was not, cannot beempirically perceived, unless a phenomenon precedes, which does notcontain in itself this state. For a reality which should follow upon avoid time, in other words, a beginning, which no state of thingsprecedes, can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself.Every apprehension of an event is therefore a perception which followsupon another perception. But as this is the case with all synthesis ofapprehension, as I have shown above in the example of a house, myapprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished fromother apprehensions. But I remark also that if in a phenomenon whichcontains an occurrence, I call the antecedent state of my perception,A, and the following state, B, the perception B can only follow A inapprehension, and the perception A cannot follow B, but only precedeit. For example, I see a ship float down the stream of a river. Myperception of its place lower down follows upon my perception of itsplace higher up the course of the river, and it is impossible that, inthe apprehension of this phenomenon, the vessel should be perceivedfirst below and afterwards higher up the stream. Here, therefore, theorder in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined; andby this order apprehension is regulated. In the former example, myperceptions in the apprehension of a house might begin at the roof andend at the foundation, or vice versa; or I might apprehend the manifoldin this empirical intuition, by going from left to right, and fromright to left. Accordingly, in the series of these perceptions, therewas no determined order, which necessitated my beginning at a certainpoint, in order empirically to connect the manifold. But this rule isalways to be met with in the perception of that which happens, and itmakes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension ofsuch a phenomenon necessary.I must, therefore, in the present case, deduce the subjective sequenceof apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena, for otherwisethe former is quite undetermined, and one phenomenon is notdistinguishable from another. The former alone proves nothing as to theconnection of the manifold in an object, for it is quite arbitrary. Thelatter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon,according to which order the apprehension of one thing (that whichhappens) follows that of another thing (which precedes), in conformitywith a rule. In this way alone can I be authorized to say of thephenomenon itself, and not merely of my own apprehension, that acertain order or sequence is to be found therein. That is, in otherwords, I cannot arrange my apprehension otherwise than in this order.In conformity with this rule, then, it is necessary that in that whichantecedes an event there be found the condition of a rule, according towhich in this event follows always and necessarily; but I cannotreverse this and go back from the event, and determine (byapprehension) that which antecedes it. For no phenomenon goes back fromthe succeeding point of time to the preceding point, although it doescertainly relate to a preceding point of time; from a given time, onthe other hand, there is always a necessary progression to thedetermined succeeding time. Therefore, because there certainly issomething that follows, I must of necessity connect it with somethingelse, which antecedes, and upon which it follows, in conformity with arule, that is necessarily, so that the event, as conditioned, affordscertain indication of a condition, and this condition determines theevent.Let us suppose that nothing precedes an event, upon which this eventmust follow in conformity with a rule. All sequence of perception wouldthen exist only in apprehension, that is to say, would be merelysubjective, and it could not thereby be objectively determined whatthing ought to precede, and what ought to follow in perception. In sucha case, we should have nothing but a play of representations, whichwould possess no application to any object. That is to say, it wouldnot be possible through perception to distinguish one phenomenon fromanother, as regards relations of time; because the succession in theact of apprehension would always be of the same sort, and thereforethere would be nothing in the phenomenon to determine the succession,and to render a certain sequence objectively necessary. And, in thiscase, I cannot say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon theother, but only that one apprehension follows upon another. But this ismerely subjective, and does not determine an object, and consequentlycannot be held to be cognition of an object—not even in the phenomenalworld.Accordingly, when we know in experience that something happens, wealways presuppose that something precedes, whereupon it follows inconformity with a rule. For otherwise I could not say of the objectthat it follows; because the mere succession in my apprehension, if itbe not determined by a rule in relation to something preceding, doesnot authorize succession in the object. Only, therefore, in referenceto a rule, according to which phenomena are determined in theirsequence, that is, as they happen, by the preceding state, can I makemy subjective synthesis (of apprehension) objective, and it is onlyunder this presupposition that even the experience of an event ispossible.No doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to allthe notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to theprocedure of the human understanding. According to these opinions, itis by means of the perception and comparison of similar consequencesfollowing upon certain antecedent phenomena that the understanding isled to the discovery of a rule, according to which certain eventsalways follow certain phenomena, and it is only by this process that weattain to the conception of cause. Upon such a basis, it is clear thatthis conception must be merely empirical, and the rule which itfurnishes us with—“Everything that happens must have a cause”—would bejust as contingent as experience itself. The universality and necessityof the rule or law would be perfectly spurious attributes of it.Indeed, it could not possess universal validity, inasmuch as it wouldnot in this case be à priori, but founded on deduction. But the same isthe case with this law as with other pure à priori representations(e.g., space and time), which we can draw in perfect clearness andcompleteness from experience, only because we had already placed themtherein, and by that means, and by that alone, had rendered experiencepossible. Indeed, the logical clearness of this representation of arule, determining the series of events, is possible only when we havemade use thereof in experience. Nevertheless, the recognition of thisrule, as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time, wasthe ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it à priori.It is now our duty to show by an example that we never, even inexperience, attribute to an object the notion of succession or effect(of an event—that is, the happening of something that did not existbefore), and distinguish it from the subjective succession ofapprehension, unless when a rule lies at the foundation, which compelsus to observe this order of perception in preference to any other, andthat, indeed, it is this necessity which first renders possible therepresentation of a succession in the object.We have representations within us, of which also we can be conscious.But, however widely extended, however accurate and thoroughgoing thisconsciousness may be, these representations are still nothing more thanrepresentations, that is, internal determinations of the mind in thisor that relation of time. Now how happens it that to theserepresentations we should set an object, or that, in addition to theirsubjective reality, as modifications, we should still further attributeto them a certain unknown objective reality? It is clear that objectivesignificancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation (ofthat which we desire to term object), for in that case the questionagain arises: “How does this other representation go out of itself, andobtain objective significancy over and above the subjective, which isproper to it, as a determination of a state of mind?” If we try todiscover what sort of new property the relation to an object gives toour subjective representations, and what new importance they therebyreceive, we shall find that this relation has no other effect than thatof rendering necessary the connection of our representations in acertain manner, and of subjecting them to a rule; and that conversely,it is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations oftime of our representations, that objective significancy is ascribed tothem.In the synthesis of phenomena, the manifold of our representations isalways successive. Now hereby is not represented an object, for bymeans of this succession, which is common to all apprehension, no onething is distinguished from another. But so soon as I perceive orassume that in this succession there is a relation to a stateantecedent, from which the representation follows in accordance with arule, so soon do I represent something as an event, or as a thing thathappens; in other words, I cognize an object to which I must assign acertain determinate position in time, which cannot be altered, becauseof the preceding state in the object. When, therefore, I perceive thatsomething happens, there is contained in this representation, in thefirst place, the fact, that something antecedes; because, it is only inrelation to this that the phenomenon obtains its proper relation oftime, in other words, exists after an antecedent time, in which it didnot exist. But it can receive its determined place in time only by thepresupposition that something existed in the foregoing state, uponwhich it follows inevitably and always, that is, in conformity with arule. From all this it is evident that, in the first place, I cannotreverse the order of succession, and make that which happens precedethat upon which it follows; and that, in the second place, if theantecedent state be posited, a certain determinate event inevitably andnecessarily follows. Hence it follows that there exists a certain orderin our representations, whereby the present gives a sure indication ofsome previously existing state, as a correlate, though stillundetermined, of the existing event which is given—a correlate whichitself relates to the event as its consequence, conditions it, andconnects it necessarily with itself in the series of time.If then it be admitted as a necessary law of sensibility, andconsequently a formal condition of all perception, that the precedingnecessarily determines the succeeding time (inasmuch as I cannot arriveat the succeeding except through the preceding), it must likewise be anindispensable law of empirical representation of the series of timethat the phenomena of the past determine all phenomena in thesucceeding time, and that the latter, as events, cannot take place,except in so far as the former determine their existence in time, thatis to say, establish it according to a rule. For it is of course onlyin phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in theconnection of times.For all experience and for the possibility of experience, understandingis indispensable, and the first step which it takes in this sphere isnot to render the representation of objects clear, but to render therepresentation of an object in general, possible. It does this byapplying the order of time to phenomena, and their existence. In otherwords, it assigns to each phenomenon, as a consequence, a place inrelation to preceding phenomena, determined à priori in time, withoutwhich it could not harmonize with time itself, which determines a placeà priori to all its parts. This determination of place cannot bederived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time (for it is notan object of perception); but, on the contrary, phenomena mustreciprocally determine the places in time of one another, and renderthese necessary in the order of time. In other words, whatever followsor happens, must follow in conformity with a universal rule upon thatwhich was contained in the foregoing state. Hence arises a series ofphenomena, which, by means of the understanding, produces and rendersnecessary exactly the same order and continuous connection in theseries of our possible perceptions, as is found à priori in the form ofinternal intuition (time), in which all our perceptions must haveplace.That something happens, then, is a perception which belongs to apossible experience, which becomes real only because I look upon thephenomenon as determined in regard to its place in time, consequentlyas an object, which can always be found by means of a rule in theconnected series of my perceptions. But this rule of the determinationof a thing according to succession in time is as follows: “In whatprecedes may be found the condition, under which an event always (thatis, necessarily) follows.” From all this it is obvious that theprinciple of cause and effect is the principle of possible experience,that is, of objective cognition of phenomena, in regard to theirrelations in the succession of time.The proof of this fundamental proposition rests entirely on thefollowing momenta of argument. To all empirical cognition belongs thesynthesis of the manifold by the imagination, a synthesis which isalways successive, that is, in which the representations therein alwaysfollow one another. But the order of succession in imagination is notdetermined, and the series of successive representations may be takenretrogressively as well as progressively. But if this synthesis is asynthesis of apprehension (of the manifold of a given phenomenon), thenthe order is determined in the object, or to speak more accurately,there is therein an order of successive synthesis which determines anobject, and according to which something necessarily precedes, and whenthis is posited, something else necessarily follows. If, then, myperception is to contain the cognition of an event, that is, ofsomething which really happens, it must be an empirical judgement,wherein we think that the succession is determined; that is, itpresupposes another phenomenon, upon which this event followsnecessarily, or in conformity with a rule. If, on the contrary, when Iposited the antecedent, the event did not necessarily follow, I shouldbe obliged to consider it merely as a subjective play of myimagination, and if in this I represented to myself anything asobjective, I must look upon it as a mere dream. Thus, the relation ofphenomena (as possible perceptions), according to which that whichhappens is, as to its existence, necessarily determined in time bysomething which antecedes, in conformity with a rule—in other words,the relation of cause and effect—is the condition of the objectivevalidity of our empirical judgements in regard to the sequence ofperceptions, consequently of their empirical truth, and therefore ofexperience. The principle of the relation of causality in thesuccession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects ofexperience, because it is itself the ground of the possibility ofexperience.Here, however, a difficulty arises, which must be resolved. Theprinciple of the connection of causality among phenomena is limited inour formula to the succession thereof, although in practice we findthat the principle applies also when the phenomena exist together inthe same time, and that cause and effect may be simultaneous. Forexample, there is heat in a room, which does not exist in the open air.I look about for the cause, and find it to be the fire, Now the fire asthe cause is simultaneous with its effect, the heat of the room. Inthis case, then, there is no succession as regards time, between causeand effect, but they are simultaneous; and still the law holds good.The greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous withtheir effects, and the succession in time of the latter is producedonly because the cause cannot achieve the total of its effect in onemoment. But at the moment when the effect first arises, it is alwayssimultaneous with the causality of its cause, because, if the cause hadbut a moment before ceased to be, the effect could not have arisen.Here it must be specially remembered that we must consider the order oftime and not the lapse thereof. The relation remains, even though notime has elapsed. The time between the causality of the cause and itsimmediate effect may entirely vanish, and the cause and effect be thussimultaneous, but the relation of the one to the other remains alwaysdeterminable according to time. If, for example, I consider a leadenball, which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it, as a cause,then it is simultaneous with the effect. But I distinguish the twothrough the relation of time of the dynamical connection of both. Forif I lay the ball upon the cushion, then the hollow follows upon thebefore smooth surface; but supposing the cushion has, from some causeor another, a hollow, there does not thereupon follow a leaden ball.Thus, the law of succession of time is in all instances the onlyempirical criterion of effect in relation to the causality of theantecedent cause. The glass is the cause of the rising of the waterabove its horizontal surface, although the two phenomena arecontemporaneous. For, as soon as I draw some water with the glass froma larger vessel, an effect follows thereupon, namely, the change of thehorizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into aconcave, which it assumes in the glass.This conception of causality leads us to the conception of action; thatof action, to the conception of force; and through it, to theconception of substance. As I do not wish this critical essay, the solepurpose of which is to treat of the sources of our syntheticalcognition à priori, to be crowded with analyses which merely explain,but do not enlarge the sphere of our conceptions, I reserve thedetailed explanation of the above conceptions for a future system ofpure reason. Such an analysis, indeed, executed with greatparticularity, may already be found in well-known works on thissubject. But I cannot at present refrain from making a few remarks onthe empirical criterion of a substance, in so far as it seems to bemore evident and more easily recognized through the conception ofaction than through that of the permanence of a phenomenon.Where action (consequently activity and force) exists, substance alsomust exist, and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitfulsource of phenomena. Very well. But if we are called upon to explainwhat we mean by substance, and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in acircle, the answer is by no means so easy. How shall we concludeimmediately from the action to the permanence of that which acts, thisbeing nevertheless an essential and peculiar criterion of substance(phenomenon)? But after what has been said above, the solution of thisquestion becomes easy enough, although by the common mode ofprocedure—merely analysing our conceptions—it would be quiteimpossible. The conception of action indicates the relation of thesubject of causality to the effect. Now because all effect consists inthat which happens, therefore in the changeable, the last subjectthereof is the permanent, as the substratum of all that changes, thatis, substance. For according to the principle of causality, actions arealways the first ground of all change in phenomena and, consequently,cannot be a property of a subject which itself changes, because if thiswere the case, other actions and another subject would be necessary todetermine this change. From all this it results that action alone, asan empirical criterion, is a sufficient proof of the presence ofsubstantiality, without any necessity on my part of endeavouring todiscover the permanence of substance by a comparison. Besides, by thismode of induction we could not attain to the completeness which themagnitude and strict universality of the conception requires. For thatthe primary subject of the causality of all arising and passing away,all origin and extinction, cannot itself (in the sphere of phenomena)arise and pass away, is a sound and safe conclusion, a conclusion whichleads us to the conception of empirical necessity and permanence inexistence, and consequently to the conception of a substance asphenomenon.When something happens, the mere fact of the occurrence, without regardto that which occurs, is an object requiring investigation. Thetransition from the non-being of a state into the existence of it,supposing that this state contains no quality which previously existedin the phenomenon, is a fact of itself demanding inquiry. Such anevent, as has been shown in No. A, does not concern substance (forsubstance does not thus originate), but its condition or state. It istherefore only change, and not origin from nothing. If this origin beregarded as the effect of a foreign cause, it is termed creation, whichcannot be admitted as an event among phenomena, because the verypossibility of it would annihilate the unity of experience. If,however, I regard all things not as phenomena, but as things inthemselves and objects of understanding alone, they, althoughsubstances, may be considered as dependent, in respect of theirexistence, on a foreign cause. But this would require a very differentmeaning in the words, a meaning which could not apply to phenomena asobjects of possible experience.How a thing can be changed, how it is possible that upon one stateexisting in one point of time, an opposite state should follow inanother point of time—of this we have not the smallest conception àpriori. There is requisite for this the knowledge of real powers, whichcan only be given empirically; for example, knowledge of moving forces,or, in other words, of certain successive phenomena (as movements)which indicate the presence of such forces. But the form of everychange, the condition under which alone it can take place as the cominginto existence of another state (be the content of the change, that is,the state which is changed, what it may), and consequently thesuccession of the states themselves can very well be considered àpriori, in relation to the law of causality and the conditions oftime.[32] [32] It must be remarked that I do not speak of the change of certain relations, but of the change of the state. Thus, when a body moves in a uniform manner, it does not change its state (of motion); but only when all motion increases or decreases.When a substance passes from one state, a, into another state, b, thepoint of time in which the latter exists is different from, andsubsequent to that in which the former existed. In like manner, thesecond state, as reality (in the phenomenon), differs from the first,in which the reality of the second did not exist, as b from zero. Thatis to say, if the state, b, differs from the state, a, only in respectto quantity, the change is a coming into existence of b -a, which inthe former state did not exist, and in relation to which that state is= O.Now the question arises how a thing passes from one state = a, intoanother state = b. Between two moments there is always a certain time,and between two states existing in these moments there is always adifference having a certain quantity (for all parts of phenomena are intheir turn quantities). Consequently, every transition from one stateinto another is always effected in a time contained between twomoments, of which the first determines the state which leaves, and thesecond determines the state into the thing passes. The thing leaves,and the second determines the state into which the thing Both moments,then, are limitations of the time of a change, consequently of theintermediate state between both, and as such they belong to the totalof the change. Now every change has a cause, which evidences itscausality in the whole time during which the charge takes place. Thecause, therefore, does not produce the change all at once or in onemoment, but in a time, so that, as the time gradually increases fromthe commencing instant, a, to its completion at b, in like manner also,the quantity of the reality (b - a) is generated through the lesserdegrees which are contained between the first and last. All change istherefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality,which, in so far as it is uniform, we call a momentum. The change doesnot consist of these momenta, but is generated or produced by them astheir effect.Such is the law of the continuity of all change, the ground of which isthat neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of partswhich are the smallest possible, but that, notwithstanding, the stateof a thing passes in the process of a change through all these parts,as elements, to its second state. There is no smallest degree ofreality in a phenomenon, just as there is no smallest degree in thequantity of time; and so the new state of reality grows up out of theformer state, through all the infinite degrees thereof, the differencesof which one from another, taken all together, are less than thedifference between o and a.It is not our business to inquire here into the utility of thisprinciple in the investigation of nature. But how such a proposition,which appears so greatly to extend our knowledge of nature, is possiblecompletely à priori, is indeed a question which deserves investigation,although the first view seems to demonstrate the truth and reality ofthe principle, and the question, how it is possible, may be consideredsuperfluous. For there are so many groundless pretensions to theenlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must take it as ageneral rule to be mistrustful of all such, and without a thoroughgoingand radical deduction, to believe nothing of the sort even on theclearest dogmatical evidence.Every addition to our empirical knowledge, and every advance made inthe exercise of our perception, is nothing more than an extension ofthe determination of the internal sense, that is to say, a progressionin time, be objects themselves what they may, phenomena, or pureintuitions. This progression in time determines everything, and isitself determined by nothing else. That is to say, the parts of theprogression exist only in time, and by means of the synthesis thereof,and are not given antecedently to it. For this reason, every transitionin perception to anything which follows upon another in time, is adetermination of time by means of the production of this perception.And as this determination of time is, always and in all its parts, aquantity, the perception produced is to be considered as a quantitywhich proceeds through all its degrees—no one of which is the smallestpossible—from zero up to its determined degree. From this we perceivethe possibility of cognizing à priori a law of changes—a law, however,which concerns their form merely. We merely anticipate our ownapprehension, the formal condition of which, inasmuch as it is itselfto be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena, mustcertainly be capable of being cognized à priori.Thus, as time contains the sensuous condition à priori of thepossibility of a continuous progression of that which exists to thatwhich follows it, the understanding, by virtue of the unity ofapperception, contains the condition à priori of the possibility of acontinuous determination of the position in time of all phenomena, andthis by means of the series of causes and effects, the former of whichnecessitate the sequence of the latter, and thereby render universallyand for all time, and by consequence, objectively, valid the empiricalcognition of the relations of time.C. THIRD ANALOGY.Principle of Coexistence, According to the Law of Reciprocity orCommunity.All substances, in so far as they can be perceived in space at the sametime, exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action.PROOF.Things are coexistent, when in empirical intuition the perception ofthe one can follow upon the perception of the other, and viceversa—which cannot occur in the succession of phenomena, as we haveshown in the explanation of the second principle. Thus I can perceivethe moon and then the earth, or conversely, first the earth and thenthe moon; and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects canreciprocally follow each other, I say, they exist contemporaneously.Now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time. Buttime itself is not an object of perception; and therefore we cannotconclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time, theother fact, that the perception of these things can follow each otherreciprocally. The synthesis of the imagination in apprehension wouldonly present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subjectwhen the other is not present, and contrariwise; but would not showthat the objects are coexistent, that is to say, that, if the oneexists, the other also exists in the same time, and that this isnecessarily so, in order that the perceptions may be capable offollowing each other reciprocally. It follows that a conception of theunderstanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of thedeterminations of phenomena (existing, as they do, apart from eachother, and yet contemporaneously), is requisite to justify us in sayingthat the reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in theobject, and to enable us to represent coexistence as objective. Butthat relation of substances in which the one contains determinationsthe ground of which is in the other substance, is the relation ofinfluence. And, when this influence is reciprocal, it is the relationof community or reciprocity. Consequently the coexistence of substancesin space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under theprecondition of their reciprocal action. This is therefore thecondition of the possibility of things themselves as objects ofexperience.Things are coexistent, in so far as they exist in one and the sametime. But how can we know that they exist in one and the same time?Only by observing that the order in the synthesis of apprehension ofthe manifold is arbitrary and a matter of indifference, that is to say,that it can proceed from A, through B, C, D, to E, or contrariwise fromE to A. For if they were successive in time (and in the order, let ussuppose, which begins with A), it is quite impossible for theapprehension in perception to begin with E and go backwards to A,inasmuch as A belongs to past time and, therefore, cannot be an objectof apprehension.Let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomenaeach is completely isolated, that is, that no one acts upon another.Then I say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object ofpossible perception and that the existence of one cannot, by any modeof empirical synthesis, lead us to the existence of another. For weimagine them in this case to be separated by a completely void space,and thus perception, which proceeds from the one to the other in time,would indeed determine their existence by means of a followingperception, but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the onephenomenon follows objectively upon the first, or is coexistent withit.Besides the mere fact of existence, then, there must be something bymeans of which A determines the position of B in time and, conversely,B the position of A; because only under this condition can substancesbe empirically represented as existing contemporaneously. Now thatalone determines the position of another thing in time which is thecause of it or of its determinations. Consequently every substance(inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of it only in respect ofits determinations) must contain the causality of certaindeterminations in another substance, and at the same time the effectsof the causality of the other in itself. That is to say, substancesmust stand (mediately or immediately) in dynamical community with eachother, if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience.But, in regard to objects of experience, that is absolutely necessarywithout which the experience of these objects would itself beimpossible. Consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substancesin the world of phenomena, in so far as they are coexistent, stand in arelation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other.The word community has in our language[33] two meanings, and containsthe two notions conveyed in the Latin communio and commercium. Weemploy it in this place in the latter sense—that of a dynamicalcommunity, without which even the community of place (communio spatii)could not be empirically cognized. In our experiences it is easy toobserve that it is only the continuous influences in all parts of spacethat can conduct our senses from one object to another; that the lightwhich plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies produces amediating community between them and us, and thereby evidences theircoexistence with us; that we cannot empirically change our position(perceive this change), unless the existence of matter throughout thewhole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions weoccupy; and that this perception can prove the contemporaneousexistence of these places only through their reciprocal influence, andthereby also the coexistence of even the most remote objects—althoughin this case the proof is only mediate. Without community, everyperception (of a phenomenon in space) is separated from every other andisolated, and the chain of empirical representations, that is, ofexperience, must, with the appearance of a new object, begin entirelyde novo, without the least connection with preceding representations,and without standing towards these even in the relation of time. Myintention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space; forit may exist where our perceptions cannot exist, inasmuch as theycannot reach thereto, and where, therefore, no empirical perception ofcoexistence takes place. But in this case it is not an object ofpossible experience. [33] GermanThe following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation. In themind, all phenomena, as contents of a possible experience, must existin community (communio) of apperception or consciousness, and in so faras it is requisite that objects be represented as coexistent andconnected, in so far must they reciprocally determine the position intime of each other and thereby constitute a whole. If this subjectivecommunity is to rest upon an objective basis, or to be applied tosubstances as phenomena, the perception of one substance must renderpossible the perception of another, and conversely. For otherwisesuccession, which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions,would be predicated of external objects, and their representation oftheir coexistence be thus impossible. But this is a reciprocalinfluence, that is to say, a real community (commercium) of substances,without which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would bea notion beyond the reach of our minds. By virtue of this commercium,phenomena, in so far as they are apart from, and nevertheless inconnection with each other, constitute a compositum reale. Suchcomposita are possible in many different ways. The three dynamicalrelations then, from which all others spring, are those of inherence,consequence, and composition.These, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothingmore than principles of the determination of the existence of phenomenain time, according to the three modi of this determination; to wit, therelation to time itself as a quantity (the quantity of existence, thatis, duration), the relation in time as a series or succession, finally,the relation in time as the complex of all existence (simultaneity).This unity of determination in regard to time is thoroughly dynamical;that is to say, time is not considered as that in which experiencedetermines immediately to every existence its position; for this isimpossible, inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of perception,by means of which phenomena can be connected with each other. On thecontrary, the rule of the understanding, through which alone theexistence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regardsrelations of time, determines for every phenomenon its position intime, and consequently à priori, and with validity for all and everytime.By nature, in the empirical sense of the word, we understand thetotality of phenomena connected, in respect of their existence,according to necessary rules, that is, laws. There are thereforecertain laws (which are moreover à priori) which make nature possible;and all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience, and byvirtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomespossible. The purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to usthe unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certainexponents, the only business of which is to express the relation oftime (in so far as it contains all existence in itself) to the unity ofapperception, which can exist in synthesis only according to rules. Thecombined expression of all is this: “All phenomena exist in one nature,and must so exist, inasmuch as without this à priori unity, no unity ofexperience, and consequently no determination of objects in experience,is possible.”As regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating ofthese transcendental laws of nature, and the peculiar character of wemust make one remark, which will at the same time be important as aguide in every other attempt to demonstrate the truth of intellectualand likewise synthetical propositions à priori. Had we endeavoured toprove these analogies dogmatically, that is, from conceptions; that isto say, had we employed this method in attempting to show thateverything which exists, exists only in that which is permanent—thatevery thing or event presupposes the existence of something in apreceding state, upon which it follows in conformity with arule—lastly, that in the manifold, which is coexistent, the statescoexist in connection with each other according to a rule, all ourlabour would have been utterly in vain. For more conceptions of things,analyse them as we may, cannot enable us to conclude from the existenceof one object to the existence of another. What other course was leftfor us to pursue? This only, to demonstrate the possibility ofexperience as a cognition in which at last all objects must be capableof being presented to us, if the representation of them is to possessany objective reality. Now in this third, this mediating term, theessential form of which consists in the synthetical unity of theapperception of all phenomena, we found à priori conditions of theuniversal and necessary determination as to time of all existences inthe world of phenomena, without which the empirical determinationthereof as to time would itself be impossible, and we also discoveredrules of synthetical unity à priori, by means of which we couldanticipate experience. For want of this method, and from the fancy thatit was possible to discover a dogmatical proof of the syntheticalpropositions which are requisite in the empirical employment of theunderstanding, has it happened that a proof of the principle ofsufficient reason has been so often attempted, and always in vain. Theother two analogies nobody has ever thought of, although they havealways been silently employed by the mind,[34] because the guidingthread furnished by the categories was wanting, the guide which alonecan enable us to discover every hiatus, both in the system ofconceptions and of principles. [34] The unity of the universe, in which all phenomena to be connected, is evidently a mere consequence of the admitted principle of the community of all substances which are coexistent. For were substances isolated, they could not as parts constitute a whole, and were their connection (reciprocal action of the manifold) not necessary from the very fact of coexistence, we could not conclude from the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former as a real one. We have, however, shown in its place that community is the proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of coexistence, and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter to the former as its condition.4. THE POSTULATES OF EMPIRICAL THOUGHT.1. That which agrees with the formal conditions (intuition andconception) of experience, is possible.2. That which coheres with the material conditions of experience(sensation), is real.3. That whose coherence with the real is determined according touniversal conditions of experience is (exists) necessary.Explanation.The categories of modality possess this peculiarity, that they do notin the least determine the object, or enlarge the conception to whichthey are annexed as predicates, but only express its relation to thefaculty of cognition. Though my conception of a thing is in itselfcomplete, I am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merelypossible, or whether it is also real, or, if the latter, whether it isalso necessary. But hereby the object itself is not more definitelydetermined in thought, but the question is only in what relation it,including all its determinations, stands to the understanding and itsemployment in experience, to the empirical faculty of judgement, and tothe reason of its application to experience.For this very reason, too, the categories of modality are nothing morethan explanations of the conceptions of possibility, reality, andnecessity, as employed in experience, and at the same time,restrictions of all the categories to empirical use alone, notauthorizing the transcendental employment of them. For if they are tohave something more than a merely logical significance, and to besomething more than a mere analytical expression of the form ofthought, and to have a relation to things and their possibility,reality, or necessity, they must concern possible experience and itssynthetical unity, in which alone objects of cognition can be given.The postulate of the possibility of things requires also, that theconception of the things agree with the formal conditions of ourexperience in general. But this, that is to say, the objective form ofexperience, contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite forthe cognition of objects. A conception which contains a synthesis mustbe regarded as empty and, without reference to an object, if itssynthesis does not belong to experience—either as borrowed from it, andin this case it is called an empirical conception, or such as is theground and à priori condition of experience (its form), and in thiscase it is a pure conception, a conception which nevertheless belongsto experience, inasmuch as its object can be found in this alone. Forwhere shall we find the criterion or character of the possibility of anobject which is cogitated by means of an à priori syntheticalconception, if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form ofempirical cognition of objects? That in such a conception nocontradiction exists is indeed a necessary logical condition, but veryfar from being sufficient to establish the objective reality of theconception, that is, the possibility of such an object as is thought inthe conception. Thus, in the conception of a figure which is containedwithin two straight lines, there is no contradiction, for theconceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain nonegation of a figure. The impossibility in such a case does not restupon the conception in itself, but upon the construction of it inspace, that is to say, upon the conditions of space and itsdeterminations. But these have themselves objective reality, that is,they apply to possible things, because they contain à priori the formof experience in general.And now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility andinfluence of this postulate of possibility. When I represent to myselfa thing that is permanent, so that everything in it which changesbelongs merely to its state or condition, from such a conception aloneI never can cognize that such a thing is possible. Or, if I representto myself something which is so constituted that, when it is posited,something else follows always and infallibly, my thought contains noself-contradiction; but whether such a property as causality is to befound in any possible thing, my thought alone affords no means ofjudging. Finally, I can represent to myself different things(substances) which are so constituted that the state or condition ofone causes a change in the state of the other, and reciprocally; butwhether such a relation is a property of things cannot be perceivedfrom these conceptions, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis.Only from the fact, therefore, that these conceptions express à priorithe relations of perceptions in every experience, do we know that theypossess objective reality, that is, transcendental truth; and thatindependent of experience, though not independent of all relation toform of an experience in general and its synthetical unity, in whichalone objects can be empirically cognized.But when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances, forces,action, and reaction, from the material presented to us by perception,without following the example of experience in their connection, wecreate mere chimeras, of the possibility of which we cannot discoverany criterion, because we have not taken experience for ourinstructress, though we have borrowed the conceptions from her. Suchfictitious conceptions derive their character of possibility not, likethe categories, à priori, as conceptions on which all experiencedepends, but only, à posteriori, as conceptions given by means ofexperience itself, and their possibility must either be cognized àposteriori and empirically, or it cannot be cognized at all. Asubstance which is permanently present in space, yet without filling it(like that tertium quid between matter and the thinking subject whichsome have tried to introduce into metaphysics), or a peculiarfundamental power of the mind of intuiting the future by anticipation(instead of merely inferring from past and present events), or,finally, a power of the mind to place itself in community of thoughtwith other men, however distant they may be—these are conceptions thepossibility of which has no ground to rest upon. For they are not basedupon experience and its known laws; and, without experience, they are amerely arbitrary conjunction of thoughts, which, though containing nointernal contradiction, has no claim to objective reality, neither,consequently, to the possibility of such an object as is thought inthese conceptions. As far as concerns reality, it is self-evident thatwe cannot cogitate such a possibility in concreto without the aid ofexperience; because reality is concerned only with sensation, as thematter of experience, and not with the form of thought, with which wecan no doubt indulge in shaping fancies.But I pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality inexperience, and I purpose treating here merely of the possibility ofthings by means of à priori conceptions. I maintain, then, that thepossibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se, butonly when considered as formal and objective conditions of anexperience in general.It seems, indeed, as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognizedfrom the conception of it alone (which is certainly independent ofexperience); for we can certainly give to the conception acorresponding object completely à priori, that is to say, we canconstruct it. But as a triangle is only the form of an object, it mustremain a mere product of the imagination, and the possibility of theexistence of an object corresponding to it must remain doubtful, unlesswe can discover some other ground, unless we know that the figure canbe cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experiencerest. Now, the facts that space is a formal condition à priori ofexternal experience, that the formative synthesis, by which weconstruct a triangle in imagination, is the very same as that we employin the apprehension of a phenomenon for the purpose of making anempirical conception of it, are what alone connect the notion of thepossibility of such a thing, with the conception of it. In the samemanner, the possibility of continuous quantities, indeed of quantitiesin general, for the conceptions of them are without exceptionsynthetical, is never evident from the conceptions in themselves, butonly when they are considered as the formal conditions of thedetermination of objects in experience. And where, indeed, should welook for objects to correspond to our conceptions, if not inexperience, by which alone objects are presented to us? It is, however,true that without antecedent experience we can cognize and characterizethe possibility of things, relatively to the formal conditions, underwhich something is determined in experience as an object, consequently,completely à priori. But still this is possible only in relation toexperience and within its limits.The postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of thingsrequires perception, consequently conscious sensation, not indeedimmediately, that is, of the object itself, whose existence is to becognized, but still that the object have some connection with a realperception, in accordance with the analogies of experience, whichexhibit all kinds of real connection in experience.From the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude itsexistence. For, let the conception be ever so complete, and containinga statement of all the determinations of the thing, the existence of ithas nothing to do with all this, but only with thew question whethersuch a thing is given, so that the perception of it can in every caseprecede the conception. For the fact that the conception of it precedesthe perception, merely indicates the possibility of its existence; itis perception which presents matter to the conception, that is the solecriterion of reality. Prior to the perception of the thing, however,and therefore comparatively à priori, we are able to cognize itsexistence, provided it stands in connection with some perceptionsaccording to the principles of the empirical conjunction of these, thatis, in conformity with the analogies of perception. For, in this case,the existence of the supposed thing is connected with our perception ina possible experience, and we are able, with the guidance of theseanalogies, to reason in the series of possible perceptions from a thingwhich we do really perceive to the thing we do not perceive. Thus, wecognize the existence of a magnetic matter penetrating all bodies fromthe perception of the attraction of the steel-filings by the magnet,although the constitution of our organs renders an immediate perceptionof this matter impossible for us. For, according to the laws ofsensibility and the connected context of our perceptions, we should inan experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of thismatter, if our senses were more acute—but this obtuseness has noinfluence upon and cannot alter the form of possible experience ingeneral. Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as ourperceptions, and what may be inferred from them according to empiricallaws, extend. If we do not set out from experience, or do not proceedaccording to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena, ourpretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do notimmediately perceive are vain. Idealism, however, brings forwardpowerful objections to these rules for proving existence mediately.This is, therefore, the proper place for its refutation.REFUTATION OF IDEALISM.Idealism—I mean material idealism—is the theory which declares theexistence of objects in space without us to be either () doubtful andindemonstrable, or (2) false and impossible. The first is theproblematical idealism of Descartes, who admits the undoubted certaintyof only one empirical assertion (assertio), to wit, “I am.” The secondis the dogmatical idealism of Berkeley, who maintains that space,together with all the objects of which it is the inseparable condition,is a thing which is in itself impossible, and that consequently theobjects in space are mere products of the imagination. The dogmaticaltheory of idealism is unavoidable, if we regard space as a property ofthings in themselves; for in that case it is, with all to which itserves as condition, a nonentity. But the foundation for this kind ofidealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental æsthetic.Problematical idealism, which makes no such assertion, but only allegesour incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves bymeans of immediate experience, is a theory rational and evidencing athorough and philosophical mode of thinking, for it observes the rulenot to form a decisive judgement before sufficient proof be shown. Thedesired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience ofexternal things, and not mere fancies. For this purpose, we must prove,that our internal and, to Descartes, indubitable experience is itselfpossible only under the previous assumption of external experience.THEOREM.The simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existenceproves the existence of external objects in space.PROOFI am conscious of my own existence as determined in time. Alldetermination in regard to time presupposes the existence of somethingpermanent in perception. But this permanent something cannot besomething in me, for the very reason that my existence in time isitself determined by this permanent something. It follows that theperception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thingwithout me and not through the mere representation of a thing withoutme. Consequently, the determination of my existence in time is possibleonly through the existence of real things external to me. Now,consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousnessof the possibility of this determination in time. Hence it follows thatconsciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existenceof things without me, inasmuch as the existence of these things is thecondition of determination in time. That is to say, the consciousnessof my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness ofthe existence of other things without me.Remark I. The reader will observe, that in the foregoing proof the gamewhich idealism plays is retorted upon itself, and with more justice. Itassumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that fromthis we can only infer the existence of external things. But, as alwayshappens, when we reason from given effects to determined causes,idealism has reasoned with too much haste and uncertainty, for it isquite possible that the cause of our representations may lie inourselves, and that we ascribe it falsely to external things. But ourproof shows that external experience is properly immediate,[35] thatonly by virtue of it—not, indeed, the consciousness of our ownexistence, but certainly the determination of our existence in time,that is, internal experience—is possible. It is true, that therepresentation “I am,” which is the expression of the consciousnesswhich can accompany all my thoughts, is that which immediately includesthe existence of a subject. But in this representation we cannot findany knowledge of the subject, and therefore also no empiricalknowledge, that is, experience. For experience contains, in addition tothe thought of something existing, intuition, and in this case it mustbe internal intuition, that is, time, in relation to which the subjectmust be determined. But the existence of external things is absolutelyrequisite for this purpose, so that it follows that internal experienceis itself possible only mediately and through external experience. [35] The immediate consciousness of the existence of external things is, in the preceding theorem, not presupposed, but proved, by the possibility of this consciousness understood by us or not. The question as to the possibility of it would stand thus: “Have we an internal sense, but no external sense, and is our belief in external perception a mere delusion?” But it is evident that, in order merely to fancy to ourselves anything as external, that is, to present it to the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense, and must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an external intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act of imagination. For merely to imagine also an external sense, would annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined by the imagination.Remark II. Now with this view all empirical use of our faculty ofcognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance. Itstruth is supported by the fact that it is possible to perceive adetermination of time only by means of a change in external relations(motion) to the permanent in space (for example, we become aware of thesun’s motion by observing the changes of his relation to the objects ofthis earth). But this is not all. We find that we possess nothingpermanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of asubstance as intuition, except matter. This idea of permanence is notitself derived from external experience, but is an à priori necessarycondition of all determination of time, consequently also of theinternal sense in reference to our own existence, and that through theexistence of external things. In the representation “I,” theconsciousness of myself is not an intuition, but a merely intellectualrepresentation produced by the spontaneous activity of a thinkingsubject. It follows, that this “i” has not any predicate of intuition,which, in its character of permanence, could serve as correlate to thedetermination of time in the internal sense—in the same way asimpenetrability is the correlate of matter as an empirical intuition.Remark III. From the fact that the existence of external things is anecessary condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness ofourselves, it does not follow that every intuitive representation ofexternal things involves the existence of these things, for theirrepresentations may very well be the mere products of the imagination(in dreams as well as in madness); though, indeed, these are themselvescreated by the reproduction of previous external perceptions, which, ashas been shown, are possible only through the reality of externalobjects. The sole aim of our remarks has, however, been to prove thatinternal experience in general is possible only through externalexperience in general. Whether this or that supposed experience bepurely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinationsand by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience.Finally, as regards the third postulate, it applies to materialnecessity in existence, and not to merely formal and logical necessityin the connection of conceptions. Now as we cannot cognize completely àpriori the existence of any object of sense, though we can do socomparatively à priori, that is, relatively to some other previouslygiven existence—a cognition, however, which can only be of such anexistence as must be contained in the complex of experience, of whichthe previously given perception is a part—the necessity of existencecan never be cognized from conceptions, but always, on the contrary,from its connection with that which is an object of perception. But theonly existence cognized, under the condition of other given phenomena,as necessary, is the existence of effects from given causes inconformity with the laws of causality. It is consequently not thenecessity of the existence of things (as substances), but the necessityof the state of things that we cognize, and that not immediately, butby means of the existence of other states given in perception,according to empirical laws of causality. Hence it follows that thecriterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possibleexperience—that everything which happens is determined à priori in thephenomenon by its cause. Thus we cognize only the necessity of effectsin nature, the causes of which are given us. Moreover, the criterion ofnecessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field ofpossible experience, and even in this it is not valid of the existenceof things as substances, because these can never be considered asempirical effects, or as something that happens and has a beginning.Necessity, therefore, regards only the relations of phenomena accordingto the dynamical law of causality, and the possibility groundedthereon, of reasoning from some given existence (of a cause) à priorito another existence (of an effect). “Everything that happens ishypothetically necessary,” is a principle which subjects the changesthat take place in the world to a law, that is, to a rule of necessaryexistence, without which nature herself could not possibly exist. Hencethe proposition, “Nothing happens by blind chance (in mundo non daturcasus),” is an à priori law of nature. The case is the same with theproposition, “Necessity in nature is not blind,” that is, it isconditioned, consequently intelligible necessity (non datur fatum).Both laws subject the play of change to “a nature of things (asphenomena),” or, which is the same thing, to the unity of theunderstanding, and through the understanding alone can changes belongto an experience, as the synthetical unity of phenomena. Both belong tothe class of dynamical principles. The former is properly a consequenceof the principle of causality—one of the analogies of experience. Thelatter belongs to the principles of modality, which to thedetermination of causality adds the conception of necessity, which isitself, however, subject to a rule of the understanding. The principleof continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded aschanges (in mundo non datur saltus); and likewise, in the complex ofall empirical intuitions in space, any break or hiatus between twophenomena (non datur hiatus)—for we can so express the principle, thatexperience can admit nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum, orwhich even admits it as a part of an empirical synthesis. For, asregards a vacuum or void, which we may cogitate as out and beyond thefield of possible experience (the world), such a question cannot comebefore the tribunal of mere understanding, which decides only uponquestions that concern the employment of given phenomena for theconstruction of empirical cognition. It is rather a problem for idealreason, which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience andaims at forming a judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribesit, and the proper place for the consideration of it is thetranscendental dialectic. These four propositions, “In mundo non daturhiatus, non datur saltus, non datur casus, non datur fatum,” as well asall principles of transcendental origin, we could very easily exhibitin their proper order, that is, in conformity with the order of thecategories, and assign to each its proper place. But the alreadypractised reader will do this for himself, or discover the clue to suchan arrangement. But the combined result of all is simply this, to admitinto the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or beforeign to the understanding and the continuous connection of allphenomena, that is, the unity of the conceptions of the understanding.For in the understanding alone is the unity of experience, in which allperceptions must have their assigned place, possible.Whether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality, andwhether the field of the latter be itself greater than that ofnecessity, are interesting enough questions, and quite capable ofsynthetic solution, questions, however, which come under thejurisdiction of reason alone. For they are tantamount to asking whetherall things as phenomena do without exception belong to the complex andconnected whole of a single experience, of which every given perceptionis a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any otherphenomena—or, whether my perceptions can belong to more than onepossible experience? The understanding gives to experience, accordingto the subjective and formal conditions, of sensibility as well as ofapperception, the rules which alone make this experience possible.Other forms of intuition besides those of space and time, other formsof understanding besides the discursive forms of thought, or ofcognition by means of conceptions, we can neither imagine nor makeintelligible to ourselves; and even if we could, they would still notbelong to experience, which is the only mode of cognition by whichobjects are presented to us. Whether other perceptions besides thosewhich belong to the total of our possible experience, and consequentlywhether some other sphere of matter exists, the understanding has nopower to decide, its proper occupation being with the synthesis of thatwhich is given. Moreover, the poverty of the usual arguments which goto prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility, of which allthat is real (every object of experience) is but a small part, is veryremarkable. “All real is possible”; from this follows naturally,according to the logical laws of conversion, the particularproposition: “Some possible is real.” Now this seems to be equivalentto: “Much is possible that is not real.” No doubt it does seem as if weought to consider the sum of the possible to be greater than that ofthe real, from the fact that something must be added to the former toconstitute the latter. But this notion of adding to the possible isabsurd. For that which is not in the sum of the possible, andconsequently requires to be added to it, is manifestly impossible. Inaddition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience, theunderstanding requires a connection with some perception; but thatwhich is connected with this perception is real, even although it isnot immediately perceived. But that another series of phenomena, incomplete coherence with that which is given in perception, consequentlymore than one all-embracing experience is possible, is an inferencewhich cannot be concluded from the data given us by experience, andstill less without any data at all. That which is possible only underconditions which are themselves merely possible, is not possible in anyrespect. And yet we can find no more certain ground on which to basethe discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility iswider than that of experience.I have merely mentioned these questions, that in treating of theconception of the understanding, there might be no omission of anythingthat, in the common opinion, belongs to them. In reality, however, thenotion of absolute possibility (possibility which is valid in everyrespect) is not a mere conception of the understanding, which can beemployed empirically, but belongs to reason alone, which passes thebounds of all empirical use of the understanding. We have, therefore,contented ourselves with a merely critical remark, leaving the subjectto be explained in the sequel.Before concluding this fourth section, and at the same time the systemof all principles of the pure understanding, it seems proper to mentionthe reasons which induced me to term the principles of modalitypostulates. This expression I do not here use in the sense which somemore recent philosophers, contrary to its meaning with mathematicians,to whom the word properly belongs, attach to it—that of a proposition,namely, immediately certain, requiring neither deduction nor proof. Forif, in the case of synthetical propositions, however evident they maybe, we accord to them without deduction, and merely on the strength oftheir own pretensions, unqualified belief, all critique of theunderstanding is entirely lost; and, as there is no want of boldpretensions, which the common belief (though for the philosopher thisis no credential) does not reject, the understanding lies exposed toevery delusion and conceit, without the power of refusing its assent tothose assertions, which, though illegitimate, demand acceptance asveritable axioms. When, therefore, to the conception of a thing an àpriori determination is synthetically added, such a proposition mustobtain, if not a proof, at least a deduction of the legitimacy of itsassertion.The principles of modality are, however, not objectively synthetical,for the predicates of possibility, reality, and necessity do not in theleast augment the conception of that of which they are affirmed,inasmuch as they contribute nothing to the representation of theobject. But as they are, nevertheless, always synthetical, they are somerely subjectively. That is to say, they have a reflective power, andapply to the conception of a thing, of which, in other respects, theyaffirm nothing, the faculty of cognition in which the conceptionoriginates and has its seat. So that if the conception merely agreewith the formal conditions of experience, its object is calledpossible; if it is in connection with perception, and determinedthereby, the object is real; if it is determined according toconceptions by means of the connection of perceptions, the object iscalled necessary. The principles of modality therefore predicate of aconception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognitionwhich generated it. Now a postulate in mathematics is a practicalproposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which wepresent an object to ourselves, and produce the conception of it, forexample—“With a given line, to describe a circle upon a plane, from agiven point”; and such a proposition does not admit of proof, becausethe procedure, which it requires, is exactly that by which alone it ispossible to generate the conception of such a figure. With the sameright, accordingly, can we postulate the principles of modality,because they do not augment[36] the conception of a thing but merelyindicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty ofcognition. [36] When I think the reality of a thing, I do really think more than the possibility, but not in the thing; for that can never contain more in reality than was contained in its complete possibility. But while the notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing in relation to the understanding (its empirical use), reality is the conjunction of the thing with perception.GENERAL REMARK ON THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES.It is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of athing from the category alone, but must always have an intuition, bywhich to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception ofthe understanding. Take, for example, the categories of relation. How(1) a thing can exist only as a subject, and not as a meredetermination of other things, that is, can be substance; or how (2),because something exists, some other thing must exist, consequently howa thing can be a cause; or how (3), when several things exist, from thefact that one of these things exists, some consequence to the othersfollows, and reciprocally, and in this way a community of substancescan be possible—are questions whose solution cannot be obtained frommere conceptions. The very same is the case with the other categories;for example, how a thing can be of the same sort with many others, thatis, can be a quantity, and so on. So long as we have not intuition wecannot know whether we do really think an object by the categories, andwhere an object can anywhere be found to cohere with them, and thus thetruth is established, that the categories are not in themselvescognitions, but mere forms of thought for the construction ofcognitions from given intuitions. For the same reason is it true thatfrom categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made. Forexample: “In every existence there is substance,” that is, somethingthat can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate; or,“Everything is a quantity”—to construct propositions such as these, werequire something to enable us to go out beyond the given conceptionand connect another with it. For the same reason the attempt to prove asynthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions, for example:“Everything that exists contingently has a cause,” has never succeeded.We could never get further than proving that, without this relation toconceptions, we could not conceive the existence of the contingent,that is, could not à priori through the understanding cognize theexistence of such a thing; but it does not hence follow that this isalso the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is saidto be contingent. If, accordingly; we look back to our proof of theprinciple of causality, we shall find that we were able to prove it asvalid only of objects of possible experience, and, indeed, only asitself the principle of the possibility of experience, Consequently ofthe cognition of an object given in empirical intuition, and not frommere conceptions. That, however, the proposition: “Everything that iscontingent must have a cause,” is evident to every one merely fromconceptions, is not to be denied. But in this case the conception ofthe contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality(as that the non-existence of which can be conceived) but that ofrelation (as that which can exist only as the consequence of somethingelse), and so it is really an identical proposition: “That which canexist only as a consequence, has a cause.” In fact, when we have togive examples of contingent existence, we always refer to changes, andnot merely to the possibility of conceiving the opposite.[37] Butchange is an event, which, as such, is possible only through a cause,and considered per se its non-existence is therefore possible, and webecome cognizant of its contingency from the fact that it can existonly as the effect of a cause. Hence, if a thing is assumed to becontingent, it is an analytical proposition to say, it has a cause. [37] We can easily conceive the non-existence of matter; but the ancients did not thence infer its contingency. But even the alternation of the existence and non-existence of a given state in a thing, in which all change consists, by no means proves the contingency of that state—the ground of proof being the reality of its opposite. For example, a body is in a state of rest after motion, but we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the former is the opposite of the latter. For this opposite is merely a logical and not a real opposite to the other. If we wish to demonstrate the contingency of the motion, what we ought to prove is that, instead of the motion which took place in the preceding point of time, it was possible for the body to have been then in rest, not, that it is afterwards in rest; for in this case, both opposites are perfectly consistent with each other.But it is still more remarkable that, to understand the possibility ofthings according to the categories and thus to demonstrate theobjective reality of the latter, we require not merely intuitions, butexternal intuitions. If, for example, we take the pure conceptions ofrelation, we find that (1) for the purpose of presenting to theconception of substance something permanent in intuition correspondingthereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality of thisconception, we require an intuition (of matter) in space, because spacealone is permanent and determines things as such, while time, and withit all that is in the internal sense, is in a state of continual flow;(2) in order to represent change as the intuition corresponding to theconception of causality, we require the representation of motion aschange in space; in fact, it is through it alone that changes, thepossibility of which no pure understanding can perceive, are capable ofbeing intuited. Change is the connection of determinationscontradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and thesame thing. Now, how it is possible that out of a given state one quiteopposite to it in the same thing should follow, reason without anexample can not only not conceive, but cannot even make intelligiblewithout intuition; and this intuition is the motion of a point inspace; the existence of which in different spaces (as a consequence ofopposite determinations) alone makes the intuition of change possible.For, in order to make even internal change cognitable, we require torepresent time, as the form of the internal sense, figuratively by aline, and the internal change by the drawing of that line (motion), andconsequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able torepresent the successive existence of ourselves in different states.The proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived aschange presupposes something permanent in intuition, while in theinternal sense no permanent intuition is to be found. Lastly, theobjective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceivedby mere reason, and consequently its objective reality cannot bedemonstrated without an intuition, and that external in space. For howcan we conceive the possibility of community, that is, when severalsubstances exist, that some effect on the existence of the one followsfrom the existence of the other, and reciprocally, and therefore that,because something exists in the latter, something else must exist inthe former, which could not be understood from its own existence alone?For this is the very essence of community—which is inconceivable as aproperty of things which are perfectly isolated. Hence, Leibnitz, inattributing to the substances of the world—as cogitated by theunderstanding alone—a community, required the mediating aid of adivinity; for, from their existence, such a property seemed to him withjustice inconceivable. But we can very easily conceive the possibilityof community (of substances as phenomena) if we represent them toourselves as in space, consequently in external intuition. For externalintuition contains in itself à priori formal external relations, as theconditions of the possibility of the real relations of action andreaction, and therefore of the possibility of community. With the sameease can it be demonstrated, that the possibility of things asquantities, and consequently the objective reality of the category ofquantity, can be grounded only in external intuition, and that by itsmeans alone is the notion of quantity appropriated by the internalsense. But I must avoid prolixity, and leave the task of illustratingthis by examples to the reader’s own reflection.The above remarks are of the greatest importance, not only for theconfirmation of our previous confutation of idealism, but still morewhen the subject of self-cognition by mere internal consciousness andthe determination of our own nature without the aid of externalempirical intuitions is under discussion, for the indication of thegrounds of the possibility of such a cognition.The result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is,therefore: “All principles of the pure understanding are nothing morethan à priori principles of the possibility of experience, and toexperience alone do all à priori synthetical propositions apply andrelate”; indeed, their possibility itself rests entirely on thisrelation.Chapter III Of the Ground of the Division of all Objects into Phenomenaand NoumenaWe have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding andcarefully surveyed every part of it, but we have also measured it, andassigned to everything therein its proper place. But this land is anisland, and enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits. Itis the land of truth (an attractive word), surrounded by a wide andstormy ocean, the region of illusion, where many a fog-bank, many aniceberg, seems to the mariner, on his voyage of discovery, a newcountry, and, while constantly deluding him with vain hopes, engageshim in dangerous adventures, from which he never can desist, and whichyet he never can bring to a termination. But before venturing upon thissea, in order to explore it in its whole extent, and to arrive at acertainty whether anything is to be discovered there, it will not bewithout advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land thatwe are about to leave, and to ask ourselves, firstly, whether we cannotrest perfectly contented with what it contains, or whether we must notof necessity be contented with it, if we can find nowhere else a solidfoundation to build upon; and, secondly, by what title we possess thisland itself, and how we hold it secure against all hostile claims?Although, in the course of our analytic, we have already givensufficient answers to these questions, yet a summary recapitulation ofthese solutions may be useful in strengthening our conviction, byuniting in one point the momenta of the arguments.We have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself,without borrowing from experience, it nevertheless possesses only forthe behoof and use of experience. The principles of the pureunderstanding, whether constitutive à priori (as the mathematicalprinciples), or merely regulative (as the dynamical), contain nothingbut the pure schema, as it were, of possible experience. For experiencepossesses its unity from the synthetical unity which the understanding,originally and from itself, imparts to the synthesis of the imaginationin relation to apperception, and in à priori relation to and agreementwith which phenomena, as data for a possible cognition, must stand. Butalthough these rules of the understanding are not only à priori true,but the very source of all truth, that is, of the accordance of ourcognition with objects, and on this ground, that they contain the basisof the possibility of experience, as the ensemble of all cognition, itseems to us not enough to propound what is true—we desire also to betold what we want to know. If, then, we learn nothing more by thiscritical examination than what we should have practised in the merelyempirical use of the understanding, without any such subtle inquiry,the presumption is that the advantage we reap from it is not worth thelabour bestowed upon it. It may certainly be answered that no rashcuriosity is more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge thanthat which must know beforehand the utility of this or that piece ofinformation which we seek, before we have entered on the needfulinvestigations, and before one could form the least conception of itsutility, even though it were placed before our eyes. But there is oneadvantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be madecomprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learner—this, namely,that the understanding which is occupied merely with empiricalexercise, and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, mayexercise its functions very well and very successfully, but is quiteunable to do one thing, and that of very great importance, todetermine, namely, the bounds that limit its employment, and to knowwhat lies within or without its own sphere. This purpose can beobtained only by such profound investigations as we have instituted.But if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within itshorizon or not, it can never be sure either as to its claims orpossessions, but must lay its account with many humiliatingcorrections, when it transgresses, as it unavoidably will, the limitsof its own territory, and loses itself in fanciful opinions andblinding illusions.That the understanding, therefore, cannot make of its à prioriprinciples, or even of its conceptions, other than an empirical use, isa proposition which leads to the most important results. Atranscendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental propositionor principle, when it is referred to things in general and consideredas things in themselves; an empirical use, when it is referred merelyto phenomena, that is, to objects of a possible experience. That thelatter use of a conception is the only admissible one is evident fromthe reasons following. For every conception are requisite, firstly, thelogical form of a conception (of thought) general; and, secondly, thepossibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply.Failing this latter, it has no sense, and utterly void of content,although it may contain the logical function for constructing aconception from certain data. Now, object cannot be given to aconception otherwise than by intuition, and, even if a pure intuitionantecedent to the object is à priori possible, this pure intuition canitself obtain objective validity only from empirical intuition, ofwhich it is itself but the form. All conceptions, therefore, and withthem all principles, however high the degree of their à prioripossibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, to data towards apossible experience. Without this they possess no objective validity,but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images ornotions. Let us take, for example, the conceptions of mathematics, andfirst in its pure intuitions. “Space has three dimensions”—“Between twopoints there can be only one straight line,” etc. Although all theseprinciples, and the representation of the object with which thisscience occupies itself, are generated in the mind entirely à priori,they would nevertheless have no significance if we were not always ableto exhibit their significance in and by means of phenomena (empiricalobjects). Hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be madesensuous, that is, that an object corresponding to it in intuition beforthcoming, otherwise the conception remains, as we say, withoutsense, that is, without meaning. Mathematics fulfils this requirementby the construction of the figure, which is a phenomenon evident to thesenses. The same science finds support and significance in number; thisin its turn finds it in the fingers, or in counters, or in lines andpoints. The conception itself is always produced à priori, togetherwith the synthetical principles or formulas from such conceptions; butthe proper employment of them, and their application to objects, canexist nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which, as regardsits form, they contain à priori.That this is also the case with all of the categories and theprinciples based upon them is evident from the fact that we cannotrender intelligible the possibility of an object corresponding to themwithout having recourse to the conditions of sensibility, consequently,to the form of phenomena, to which, as their only proper objects, theiruse must therefore be confined, inasmuch as, if this condition isremoved, all significance, that is, all relation to an object,disappears, and no example can be found to make it comprehensible whatsort of things we ought to think under such conceptions.The conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that itis the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how manytimes one is placed in it. But this “how many times” is based uponsuccessive repetition, consequently upon time and the synthesis of thehomogeneous therein. Reality, in contradistinction to negation, can beexplained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith oris void. If I leave out the notion of permanence (which is existence inall time), there remains in the conception of substance nothing but thelogical notion of subject, a notion of which I endeavour to realize byrepresenting to myself something that can exist only as a subject. Butnot only am I perfectly ignorant of any conditions under which thislogical prerogative can belong to a thing, I can make nothing out ofthe notion, and draw no inference from it, because no object to whichto apply the conception is determined, and we consequently do not knowwhether it has any meaning at all. In like manner, if I leave out thenotion of time, in which something follows upon some other thing inconformity with a rule, I can find nothing in the pure category, exceptthat there is a something of such a sort that from it a conclusion maybe drawn as to the existence of some other thing. But in this case itwould not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause and aneffect, but, as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions ofwhich I am quite ignorant, the conception is not determined as to themode in which it ought to apply to an object. The so-called principle:“Everything that is contingent has a cause,” comes with a gravity andself-assumed authority that seems to require no support from without.But, I ask, what is meant by contingent? The answer is that thenon-existence of which is possible. But I should like very well to knowby what means this possibility of non-existence is to be cognized, ifwe do not represent to ourselves a succession in the series ofphenomena, and in this succession an existence which follows anon-existence, or conversely, consequently, change. For to say, thatthe non-existence of a thing is not self-contradictory is a lame appealto a logical condition, which is no doubt a necessary condition of theexistence of the conception, but is far from being sufficient for thereal objective possibility of non-existence. I can annihilate inthought every existing substance without self-contradiction, but Icannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence, thatis to say, the possibility of their non-existence in itself. As regardsthe category of community, it may easily be inferred that, as the purecategories of substance and causality are incapable of a definition andexplanation sufficient to determine their object without the aid ofintuition, the category of reciprocal causality in the relation ofsubstances to each other (commercium) is just as little susceptiblethereof. Possibility, existence, and necessity nobody has ever yet beenable to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology, when thedefinition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding. For thesubstitution of the logical possibility of the conception—the conditionof which is that it be not self-contradictory, for the transcendentalpossibility of things—the condition of which is that there be an objectcorresponding to the conception, is a trick which can only deceive theinexperienced.[38] [38] In one word, to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding object, and consequently their real possibility cannot be demonstrated, if we take away sensuous intuition—the only intuition which we possess—and there then remains nothing but the logical possibility, that is, the fact that the conception or thought is possible—which, however, is not the question; what we want to know being, whether it relates to an object and thus possesses any meaning.It follows incontestably, that the pure conceptions of theunderstanding are incapable of transcendental, and must always be ofempirical use alone, and that the principles of the pure understandingrelate only to the general conditions of a possible experience, toobjects of the senses, and never to things in general, apart from themode in which we intuite them.Transcendental analytic has accordingly this important result, to wit,that the understanding is competent effect nothing à priori, except theanticipation of the form of a possible experience in general, and that,as that which is not phenomenon cannot be an object of experience, itcan never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which aloneobjects are presented to us. Its principles are merely principles ofthe exposition of phenomena, and the proud name of an ontology, whichprofesses to present synthetical cognitions à priori of things ingeneral in a systematic doctrine, must give place to the modest titleof analytic of the pure understanding.Thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object. If themode of this intuition is unknown to us, the object is merelytranscendental, and the conception of the understanding is employedonly transcendentally, that is, to produce unity in the thought of amanifold in general. Now a pure category, in which all conditions ofsensuous intuition—as the only intuition we possess—are abstracted,does not determine an object, but merely expresses the thought of anobject in general, according to different modes. Now, to employ aconception, the function of judgement is required, by which an objectis subsumed under the conception, consequently the at least formalcondition, under which something can be given in intuition. Failingthis condition of judgement (schema), subsumption is impossible; forthere is in such a case nothing given, which may be subsumed under theconception. The merely transcendental use of the categories istherefore, in fact, no use at all and has no determined, or even, asregards its form, determinable object. Hence it follows that the purecategory is incompetent to establish a synthetical à priori principle,and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empiricaland never of transcendental use, and that beyond the sphere of possibleexperience no synthetical à priori principles are possible.It may be advisable, therefore, to express ourselves thus. The purecategories, apart from the formal conditions of sensibility, have amerely transcendental meaning, but are nevertheless not oftranscendental use, because this is in itself impossible, inasmuch asall the conditions of any employment or use of them (in judgements) areabsent, to wit, the formal conditions of the subsumption of an objectunder these conceptions. As, therefore, in the character of purecategories, they must be employed empirically, and cannot be employedtranscendentally, they are of no use at all, when separated fromsensibility, that is, they cannot be applied to an object. They aremerely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respectof objects in general and of thought, without its being at the sametime possible to think or to determine any object by their means. Butthere lurks at the foundation of this subject an illusion which it isvery difficult to avoid. The categories are not based, as regards theirorigin, upon sensibility, like the forms of intuition, space, and time;they seem, therefore, to be capable of an application beyond the sphereof sensuous objects. But this is not the case. They are nothing butmere forms of thought, which contain only the logical faculty ofuniting à priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition.Apart, then, from the only intuition possible for us, they have stillless meaning than the pure sensuous forms, space and time, for throughthem an object is at least given, while a mode of connection of themanifold, when the intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting,has no meaning at all. At the same time, when we designate certainobjects as phenomena or sensuous existences, thus distinguishing ourmode of intuiting them from their own nature as things in themselves,it is evident that by this very distinction we as it were place thelatter, considered in this their own nature, although we do not sointuite them, in opposition to the former, or, on the other hand, we doso place other possible things, which are not objects of our senses,but are cogitated by the understanding alone, and call themintelligible existences (noumena). Now the question arises whether thepure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance inrespect of these latter, and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them.But we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity, which mayeasily occasion great misapprehension. The understanding, when it termsan object in a certain relation phenomenon, at the same time forms outof this relation a representation or notion of an object in itself, andhence believes that it can form also conceptions of such objects. Nowas the understanding possesses no other fundamental conceptions besidesthe categories, it takes for granted that an object considered as athing in itself must be capable of being thought by means of these pureconceptions, and is thereby led to hold the perfectly undeterminedconception of an intelligible existence, a something out of the sphereof our sensibility, for a determinate conception of an existence whichwe can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding.If, by the term noumenon, we understand a thing so far as it is not anobject of our sensuous intuition, thus making abstraction of our modeof intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word.But if we understand by it an object of a non-sensuous intuition, we inthis case assume a peculiar mode of intuition, an intellectualintuition, to wit, which does not, however, belong to us, of the verypossibility of which we have no notion—and this is a noumenon in thepositive sense.The doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in thenegative sense, that is, of things which the understanding is obligedto cogitate apart from any relation to our mode of intuition,consequently not as mere phenomena, but as things in themselves. Butthe understanding at the same time comprehends that it cannot employits categories for the consideration of things in themselves, becausethese possess significance only in relation to the unity of intuitionsin space and time, and that they are competent to determine this unityby means of general à priori connecting conceptions only on account ofthe pure ideality of space and time. Where this unity of time is not tobe met with, as is the case with noumena, the whole use, indeed thewhole meaning of the categories is entirely lost, for even thepossibility of things to correspond to the categories is in this caseincomprehensible. On this point, I need only refer the reader to what Ihave said at the commencement of the General Remark appended to theforegoing chapter. Now, the possibility of a thing can never be provedfrom the fact that the conception of it is not self-contradictory, butonly by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception. If,therefore, we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot beregarded as phenomena, we must have an intuition different from thesensuous, and in this case the objects would be a noumena in thepositive sense of the word. Now, as such an intuition, that is, anintellectual intuition, is no part of our faculty of cognition, it isabsolutely impossible for the categories to possess any applicationbeyond the limits of experience. It may be true that there areintelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous intuition hasno relation, and cannot be applied, but our conceptions of theunderstanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition, donot extend to these. What, therefore, we call noumenon must beunderstood by us as such in a negative sense.If I take away from an empirical intuition all thought (by means of thecategories), there remains no cognition of any object; for by means ofmere intuition nothing is cogitated, and, from the existence of such orsuch an affection of sensibility in me, it does not follow that thisaffection or representation has any relation to an object without me.But if I take away all intuition, there still remains the form ofthought, that is, the mode of determining an object for the manifold ofa possible intuition. Thus the categories do in some measure reallyextend further than sensuous intuition, inasmuch as they think objectsin general, without regard to the mode (of sensibility) in which theseobjects are given. But they do not for this reason apply to anddetermine a wider sphere of objects, because we cannot assume that suchcan be given, without presupposing the possibility of another than thesensuous mode of intuition, a supposition we are not justified inmaking.I call a conception problematical which contains in itself nocontradiction, and which is connected with other cognitions as alimitation of given conceptions, but whose objective reality cannot becognized in any manner. The conception of a noumenon, that is, of athing which must be cogitated not as an object of sense, but as a thingin itself (solely through the pure understanding), is notself-contradictory, for we are not entitled to maintain thatsensibility is the only possible mode of intuition. Nay, further, thisconception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within thebounds of phenomena, and thus to limit the objective validity ofsensuous cognition; for things in themselves, which lie beyond itsprovince, are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating thatthis cognition does not extend its application to all that theunderstanding thinks. But, after all, the possibility of such noumenais quite incomprehensible, and beyond the sphere of phenomena, all isfor us a mere void; that is to say, we possess an understanding whoseprovince does problematically extend beyond this sphere, but we do notpossess an intuition, indeed, not even the conception of a possibleintuition, by means of which objects beyond the region of sensibilitycould be given us, and in reference to which the understanding might beemployed assertorically. The conception of a noumenon is thereforemerely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use. Butit is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion, but is connected with thelimitation of sensibility, without, however, being capable ofpresenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere.The division of objects into phenomena and noumena, and of the worldinto a mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quiteinadmissible in a positive sense, although conceptions do certainlyadmit of such a division; for the class of noumena have no determinateobject corresponding to them, and cannot therefore possess objectivevalidity. If we abandon the senses, how can it be made conceivable thatthe categories (which are the only conceptions that could serve asconceptions for noumena) have any sense or meaning at all, inasmuch assomething more than the mere unity of thought, namely, a possibleintuition, is requisite for their application to an object? Theconception of a noumenon, considered as merely problematical, is,however, not only admissible, but, as a limitative conception ofsensibility, absolutely necessary. But, in this case, a noumenon is nota particular intelligible object for our understanding; on thecontrary, the kind of understanding to which it could belong is itselfa problem, for we cannot form the most distant conception of thepossibility of an understanding which should cognize an object, notdiscursively by means of categories, but intuitively in a non-sensuousintuition. Our understanding attains in this way a sort of negativeextension. That is to say, it is not limited by, but rather limits,sensibility, by giving the name of noumena to things, not considered asphenomena, but as things in themselves. But it at the same timeprescribes limits to itself, for it confesses itself unable to cognizethese by means of the categories, and hence is compelled to cogitatethem merely as an unknown something.I find, however, in the writings of modern authors, an entirelydifferent use of the expressions, mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis,which quite departs from the meaning of the ancients—an acceptation inwhich, indeed, there is to be found no difficulty, but which at thesame time depends on mere verbal quibbling. According to this meaning,some have chosen to call the complex of phenomena, in so far as it isintuited, mundus sensibilis, but in so far as the connection thereof iscogitated according to general laws of thought, mundus intelligibilis.Astronomy, in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of thestarry heaven, may represent the former; a system of astronomy, such asthe Copernican or Newtonian, the latter. But such twisting of words isa mere sophistical subterfuge, to avoid a difficult question, bymodifying its meaning to suit our own convenience. To be sure,understanding and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena;but the question is, whether these can be applied when the object isnot a phenomenon and in this sense we regard it if it is cogitated asgiven to the understanding alone, and not to the senses. The questiontherefore is whether, over and above the empirical use of theunderstanding, a transcendental use is possible, which applies to thenoumenon as an object. This question we have answered in the negative.When therefore we say, the senses represent objects as they appear, theunderstanding as they are, the latter statement must not be understoodin a transcendental, but only in an empirical signification, that is,as they must be represented in the complete connection of phenomena,and not according to what they may be, apart from their relation topossible experience, consequently not as objects of the pureunderstanding. For this must ever remain unknown to us. Nay, it is alsoquite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinarycognition is possible under any circumstances, at least, whether it ispossible by means of our categories. Understanding and sensibility,with us, can determine objects only in conjunction. If we separatethem, we have intuitions without conceptions, or conceptions withoutintuitions; in both cases, representations, which we cannot apply toany determinate object.If, after all our inquiries and explanations, any one still hesitatesto abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories, let himattempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition. It would, ofcourse, be unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analyticalproposition, for that does not extend the sphere of the understanding,but, being concerned only about what is cogitated in the conceptionitself, it leaves it quite undecided whether the conception has anyrelation to objects, or merely indicates the unity of thought—completeabstraction being made of the modi in which an object may be given: insuch a proposition, it is sufficient for the understanding to know whatlies in the conception—to what it applies is to it indifferent. Theattempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and so-calledtranscendental principle, for example: “Everything that exists, existsas substance,” or, “Everything that is contingent exists as an effectof some other thing, viz., of its cause.” Now I ask, whence can theunderstanding draw these synthetical propositions, when the conceptionscontained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things inthemselves (noumena)? Where is to be found the third term, which isalways requisite PURE site in a synthetical proposition, which mayconnect in the same proposition conceptions which have no logical(analytical) connection with each other? The proposition never will bedemonstrated, nay, more, the possibility of any such pure assertionnever can be shown, without making reference to the empirical use ofthe understanding, and thus, ipso facto, completely renouncing pure andnon-sensuous judgement. Thus the conception of pure and merelyintelligible objects is completely void of all principles of itsapplication, because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might begiven, and the problematical thought which leaves a place open for themserves only, like a void space, to limit the use of empiricalprinciples, without containing at the same time any other object ofcognition beyond their sphere.APPENDIXOf the Equivocal Nature or Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflectionfrom the Confusion of the Transcendental with the Empirical use of theUnderstanding.Reflection (reflexio) is not occupied about objects themselves, for thepurpose of directly obtaining conceptions of them, but is that state ofthe mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjectiveconditions under which we obtain conceptions. It is the consciousnessof the relation of given representations to the different sources orfaculties of cognition, by which alone their relation to each other canbe rightly determined. The first question which occurs in consideringour representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong? Tothe understanding or to the senses? Many judgements are admitted to betrue from mere habit or inclination; but, because reflection neitherprecedes nor follows, it is held to be a judgement that has its originin the understanding. All judgements do not require examination, thatis, investigation into the grounds of their truth. For, when they areimmediately certain (for example: “Between two points there can be onlyone straight line”), no better or less mediate test of their truth canbe found than that which they themselves contain and express. But alljudgement, nay, all comparisons require reflection, that is, adistinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptionsbelong. The act whereby I compare my representations with the facultyof cognition which originates them, and whereby I distinguish whetherthey are compared with each other as belonging to the pureunderstanding or to sensuous intuition, I term transcendentalreflection. Now, the relations in which conceptions can stand to eachother are those of identity and difference, agreement and opposition,of the internal and external, finally, of the determinable and thedetermining (matter and form). The proper determination of theserelations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition theysubjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding? For, onthe manner in which we solve this question depends the manner in whichwe must cogitate these relations.Before constructing any objective judgement, we compare the conceptionsthat are to be placed in the judgement, and observe whether thereexists identity (of many representations in one conception), if ageneral judgement is to be constructed, or difference, if a particular;whether there is agreement when affirmative; and opposition whennegative judgements are to be constructed, and so on. For this reasonwe ought to call these conceptions, conceptions of comparison(conceptus comparationis). But as, when the question is not as to thelogical form, but as to the content of conceptions, that is to say,whether the things themselves are identical or different, in agreementor opposition, and so on, the things can have a twofold relation to ourfaculty of cognition, to wit, a relation either to sensibility or tothe understanding, and as on this relation depends their relation toeach other, transcendental reflection, that is, the relation of givenrepresentations to one or the other faculty of cognition, can alonedetermine this latter relation. Thus we shall not be able to discoverwhether the things are identical or different, in agreement oropposition, etc., from the mere conception of the things by means ofcomparison (comparatio), but only by distinguishing the mode ofcognition to which they belong, in other words, by means oftranscendental reflection. We may, therefore, with justice say, thatlogical reflection is mere comparison, for in it no account is taken ofthe faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong, andthey are consequently, as far as regards their origin, to be treated ashomogeneous; while transcendental reflection (which applies to theobjects themselves) contains the ground of the possibility of objectivecomparison of representations with each other, and is therefore verydifferent from the former, because the faculties of cognition to whichthey belong are not even the same. Transcendental reflection is a dutywhich no one can neglect who wishes to establish an à priori judgementupon things. We shall now proceed to fulfil this duty, and therebythrow not a little light on the question as to the determination of theproper business of the understanding.1. Identity and Difference. When an object is presented to us severaltimes, but always with the same internal determinations (qualitas etquantitas), it, if an object of pure understanding, is always the same,not several things, but only one thing (numerica identitas); but if aphenomenon, we do not concern ourselves with comparing the conceptionof the thing with the conception of some other, but, although they maybe in this respect perfectly the same, the difference of place at thesame time is a sufficient ground for asserting the numerical differenceof these objects (of sense). Thus, in the case of two drops of water,we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (qualityand quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time indifferent places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to benumerically different. Leibnitz regarded phenomena as things inthemselves, consequently as intelligibilia, that is, objects of pureunderstanding (although, on account of the confused nature of theirrepresentations, he gave them the name of phenomena), and in this casehis principle of the indiscernible (principium identatisindiscernibilium) is not to be impugned. But, as phenomena are objectsof sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must beemployed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality andnumerical difference are given by space itself as the condition ofexternal phenomena. For one part of space, although it may be perfectlysimilar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for thisreason alone is different from the latter, which is added to it inorder to make up a greater space. It follows that this must hold goodof all things that are in the different parts of space at the sametime, however similar and equal one may be to another.2. Agreement and Opposition. When reality is represented by the pureunderstanding (realitas noumenon), opposition between realities isincogitable—such a relation, that is, that when these realities areconnected in one subject, they annihilate the effects of each other andmay be represented in the formula 3 -3 = 0. On the other hand, the realin a phenomenon (realitas phaenomenon) may very well be in mutualopposition, and, when united in the same subject, the one maycompletely or in part annihilate the effect or consequence of theother; as in the case of two moving forces in the same straight linedrawing or impelling a point in opposite directions, or in the case ofa pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain.3. The Internal and External. In an object of the pure understanding,only that is internal which has no relation (as regards its existence)to anything different from itself. On the other hand, the internaldeterminations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing butrelations, and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mererelations. Substance in space we are cognizant of only through forcesoperative in it, either drawing others towards itself (attraction), orpreventing others from forcing into itself (repulsion andimpenetrability). We know no other properties that make up theconception of substance phenomenal in space, and which we term matter.On the other hand, as an object of the pure understanding, everysubstance must have internal determination and forces. But what otherinternal attributes of such an object can I think than those which myinternal sense presents to me? That, to wit, which in either itselfthought, or something analogous to it. Hence Leibnitz, who looked uponthings as noumena, after denying them everything like externalrelation, and therefore also composition or combination, declared thatall substances, even the component parts of matter, were simplesubstances with powers of representation, in one word, monads.4. Matter and Form. These two conceptions lie at the foundation of allother reflection, so inseparably are they connected with every mode ofexercising the understanding. The former denotes the determinable ingeneral, the second its determination, both in a transcendental sense,abstraction being made of every difference in that which is given, andof the mode in which it is determined. Logicians formerly termed theuniversal, matter, the specific difference of this or that part of theuniversal, form. In a judgement one may call the given conceptionslogical matter (for the judgement), the relation of these to each other(by means of the copula), the form of the judgement. In an object, thecomposite parts thereof (essentialia) are the matter; the mode in whichthey are connected in the object, the form. In respect to things ingeneral, unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of allpossibility, the limitation thereof (negation) as the form, by whichone thing is distinguished from another according to transcendentalconceptions. The understanding demands that something be given (atleast in the conception), in order to be able to determine it in acertain manner. Hence, in a conception of the pure understanding, thematter precedes the form, and for this reason Leibnitz first assumedthe existence of things (monads) and of an internal power ofrepresentation in them, in order to found upon this their externalrelation and the community their state (that is, of theirrepresentations). Hence, with him, space and time were possible—theformer through the relation of substances, the latter through theconnection of their determinations with each other, as causes andeffects. And so would it really be, if the pure understanding werecapable of an immediate application to objects, and if space and timewere determinations of things in themselves. But being merely sensuousintuitions, in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena, theform of intuition (as a subjective property of sensibility) mustantecede all matter (sensations), consequently space and time mustantecede all phenomena and all data of experience, and rather makeexperience itself possible. But the intellectual philosopher could notendure that the form should precede the things themselves and determinetheir possibility; an objection perfectly correct, if we assume that weintuite things as they are, although with confused representation. Butas sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective condition, which is àpriori at the foundation of all perception, and the form of which isprimitive, the form must be given per se, and so far from matter (orthe things themselves which appear) lying at the foundation ofexperience (as we must conclude, if we judge by mere conceptions), thevery possibility of itself presupposes, on the contrary, a given formalintuition (space and time).REMARK ON THE AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION.Let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conceptioneither in the sensibility or in the pure understanding, thetranscendental place. In this manner, the appointment of the positionwhich must be taken by each conception according to the difference inits use, and the directions for determining this place to allconceptions according to rules, would be a transcendental topic, adoctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the surreptitiousdevices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence arise,as it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition eachconception properly belonged. Every conception, every title, underwhich many cognitions rank together, may be called a logical place.Upon this is based the logical topic of Aristotle, of which teachersand rhetoricians could avail themselves, in order, under certain titlesof thought, to observe what would best suit the matter they had totreat, and thus enable themselves to quibble and talk with fluency andan appearance of profundity.Transcendental topic, on the contrary, contains nothing more than theabove-mentioned four titles of all comparison and distinction, whichdiffer from categories in this respect, that they do not represent theobject according to that which constitutes its conception (quantity,reality), but set forth merely the comparison of representations, whichprecedes our conceptions of things. But this comparison requires aprevious reflection, that is, a determination of the place to which therepresentations of the things which are compared belong, whether, towit, they are cogitated by the pure understanding, or given bysensibility.Conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiringto what faculty their objects belong, whether as noumena, to theunderstanding, or as phenomena, to sensibility. If, however, we wish toemploy these conceptions in respect of objects, previous transcendentalreflection is necessary. Without this reflection I should make a veryunsafe use of these conceptions, and construct pretended syntheticalpropositions which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which arebased solely upon a transcendental amphiboly, that is, upon asubstitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon.For want of this doctrine of transcendental topic, and consequentlydeceived by the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection, thecelebrated Leibnitz constructed an intellectual system of the world, orrather, believed himself competent to cognize the internal nature ofthings, by comparing all objects merely with the understanding and theabstract formal conceptions of thought. Our table of the conceptions ofreflection gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibitthe distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its parts, and atthe same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this peculiarmode of thought, which rested upon naught but a misconception. Hecompared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions, andnaturally found no other differences than those by which theunderstanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another. Theconditions of sensuous intuition, which contain in themselves their ownmeans of distinction, he did not look upon as primitive, becausesensibility was to him but a confused mode of representation and notany particular source of representations. A phenomenon was for him therepresentation of the thing in itself, although distinguished fromcognition by the understanding only in respect of the logical form—theformer with its usual want of analysis containing, according to him, acertain mixture of collateral representations in its conception of athing, which it is the duty of the understanding to separate anddistinguish. In one word, Leibnitz intellectualized phenomena, just asLocke, in his system of noogony (if I may be allowed to make use ofsuch expressions), sensualized the conceptions of the understanding,that is to say, declared them to be nothing more than empirical orabstract conceptions of reflection. Instead of seeking in theunderstanding and sensibility two different sources of representations,which, however, can present us with objective judgements of things onlyin conjunction, each of these great men recognized but one of thesefaculties, which, in their opinion, applied immediately to things inthemselves, the other having no duty but that of confusing or arrangingthe representations of the former.Accordingly, the objects of sense were compared by Leibnitz as thingsin general merely in the understanding.1st. He compares them in regard to their identity or difference—asjudged by the understanding. As, therefore, he considered merely theconceptions of objects, and not their position in intuition, in whichalone objects can be given, and left quite out of sight thetranscendental locale of these conceptions—whether, that is, theirobject ought to be classed among phenomena, or among things inthemselves, it was to be expected that he should extend the applicationof the principle of indiscernibles, which is valid solely ofconceptions of things in general, to objects of sense (mundusphaenomenon), and that he should believe that he had therebycontributed in no small degree to extend our knowledge of nature. Intruth, if I cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water asa thing in itself, I cannot look upon one drop as different fromanother, if the conception of the one is completely identical with thatof the other. But if it is a phenomenon in space, it has a place notmerely in the understanding (among conceptions), but also in sensuousexternal intuition (in space), and in this case, the physical locale isa matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations ofthings, and one place, B, may contain a thing which is perfectlysimilar and equal to another in a place, A, just as well as if the twothings were in every respect different from each other. Difference ofplace without any other conditions, makes the plurality and distinctionof objects as phenomena, not only possible in itself, but evennecessary. Consequently, the above so-called law is not a law ofnature. It is merely an analytical rule for the comparison of things bymeans of mere conceptions.2nd. The principle: “Realities (as simple affirmations) never logicallycontradict each other,” is a proposition perfectly true respecting therelation of conceptions, but, whether as regards nature, or things inthemselves (of which we have not the slightest conception), is withoutany the least meaning. For real opposition, in which A -B is = 0,exists everywhere, an opposition, that is, in which one reality unitedwith another in the same subject annihilates the effects of the other—afact which is constantly brought before our eyes by the differentantagonistic actions and operations in nature, which, nevertheless, asdepending on real forces, must be called realitates phaenomena. Generalmechanics can even present us with the empirical condition of thisopposition in an à priori rule, as it directs its attention to theopposition in the direction of forces—a condition of which thetranscendental conception of reality can tell us nothing. Although M.Leibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of anew principle, he yet employed it for the establishment of newpropositions, and his followers introduced it into theirLeibnitzio-Wolfian system of philosophy. According to this principle,for example, all evils are but consequences of the limited nature ofcreated beings, that is, negations, because these are the only oppositeof reality. (In the mere conception of a thing in general this isreally the case, but not in things as phenomena.) In like manner, theupholders of this system deem it not only possible, but natural also,to connect and unite all reality in one being, because they acknowledgeno other sort of opposition than that of contradiction (by which theconception itself of a thing is annihilated), and find themselvesunable to conceive an opposition of reciprocal destruction, so tospeak, in which one real cause destroys the effect of another, and theconditions of whose representation we meet with only in sensibility.3rd. The Leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than onthis philosopher’s mode of falsely representing the difference of theinternal and external solely in relation to the understanding.Substances, in general, must have something inward, which is thereforefree from external relations, consequently from that of compositionalso. The simple—that which can be represented by a unit—is thereforethe foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves. Theinternal state of substances cannot therefore consist in place, shape,contact, or motion, determinations which are all external relations,and we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby we internallydetermine our faculty of sense itself, that is to say, the state ofrepresentation. Thus, then, were constructed the monads, which were toform the elements of the universe, the active force of which consistsin representation, the effects of this force being thus entirelyconfined to themselves.For the same reason, his view of the possible community of substancescould not represent it but as a predetermined harmony, and by no meansas a physical influence. For inasmuch as everything is occupied onlyinternally, that is, with its own representations, the state of therepresentations of one substance could not stand in active and livingconnection with that of another, but some third cause operating on allwithout exception was necessary to make the different states correspondwith one another. And this did not happen by means of assistanceapplied in each particular case (systema assistentiae), but through theunity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with allsubstances, in which they necessarily receive, according to theLeibnitzian school, their existence and permanence, consequently alsoreciprocal correspondence, according to universal laws.4th. This philosopher’s celebrated doctrine of space and time, in whichhe intellectualized these forms of sensibility, originated in the samedelusion of transcendental reflection. If I attempt to represent by themere understanding, the external relations of things, I can do so onlyby employing the conception of their reciprocal action, and if I wishto connect one state of the same thing with another state, I must availmyself of the notion of the order of cause and effect. And thusLeibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community ofsubstances, and time as the dynamical sequence of their states. Thatwhich space and time possess proper to themselves and independent ofthings, he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions ofthem, whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is heldto be a self-existent intuition, antecedent even to things themselves.Thus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection ofthings (substances and their states) in themselves. But things wereintelligible substances (substantiae noumena). At the same time, hemade these conceptions valid of phenomena, because he did not allow tosensibility a peculiar mode of intuition, but sought all, even theempirical representation of objects, in the understanding, and left tosense naught but the despicable task of confusing and disarranging therepresentations of the former.But even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerningthings in themselves by means of the pure understanding (which isimpossible), it could not apply to phenomena, which do not representthings in themselves. In such a case I should be obliged intranscendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under theconditions of sensibility, and so space and time would not bedeterminations of things in themselves, but of phenomena. What thingsmay be in themselves, I know not and need not know, because a thing isnever presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon.I must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions ofreflection. Matter is substantia phaenomenon. That in it which isinternal I seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies,and in all the functions and operations it performs, and which areindeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense. I cannottherefore find anything that is absolutely, but only what iscomparatively internal, and which itself consists of externalrelations. The absolutely internal in matter, and as it should beaccording to the pure understanding, is a mere chimera, for matter isnot an object for the pure understanding. But the transcendentalobject, which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter,is a mere nescio quid, the nature of which we could not understand,even though someone were found able to tell us. For we can understandnothing that does not bring with it something in intuitioncorresponding to the expressions employed. If, by the complaint ofbeing unable to perceive the internal nature of things, it is meantthat we do not comprehend by the pure understanding what the thingswhich appear to us may be in themselves, it is a silly and unreasonablecomplaint; for those who talk thus really desire that we should be ableto cognize, consequently to intuite, things without senses, andtherefore wish that we possessed a faculty of cognition perfectlydifferent from the human faculty, not merely in degree, but even asregards intuition and the mode thereof, so that thus we should not bemen, but belong to a class of beings, the possibility of whoseexistence, much less their nature and constitution, we have no means ofcognizing. By observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate intothe interior of nature, and no one can say what progress this knowledgemay make in time. But those transcendental questions which pass beyondthe limits of nature, we could never answer, even although all naturewere laid open to us, because we have not the power of observing ourown mind with any other intuition than that of our internal sense. Forherein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our faculty ofsensibility. Its application to an object, and the transcendentalground of this unity of subjective and objective, lie too deeplyconcealed for us, who cognize ourselves only through the internalsense, consequently as phenomena, to be able to discover in ourexistence anything but phenomena, the non-sensuous cause of which we atthe same time earnestly desire to penetrate to.The great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by theprocesses of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of thenullity of all conclusions respecting objects which are compared witheach other in the understanding alone, while it at the same timeconfirms what we particularly insisted on, namely, that, althoughphenomena are not included as things in themselves among the objects ofthe pure understanding, they are nevertheless the only things by whichour cognition can possess objective reality, that is to say, which giveus intuitions to correspond with our conceptions.When we reflect in a purely logical manner, we do nothing more thancompare conceptions in our understanding, to discover whether both havethe same content, whether they are self-contradictory or not, whetheranything is contained in either conception, which of the two is given,and which is merely a mode of thinking that given. But if I apply theseconceptions to an object in general (in the transcendental sense),without first determining whether it is an object of sensuous orintellectual intuition, certain limitations present themselves, whichforbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical useof them impossible. And thus these limitations prove that therepresentation of an object as a thing in general is not onlyinsufficient, but, without sensuous determination and independently ofempirical conditions, self-contradictory; that we must therefore makeabstraction of all objects, as in logic, or, admitting them, must thinkthem under conditions of sensuous intuition; that, consequently, theintelligible requires an altogether peculiar intuition, which we do notpossess, and in the absence of which it is for us nothing; while, onthe other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves. For, when Imerely think things in general, the difference in their externalrelations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves; onthe contrary, the former presupposes the latter, and if the conceptionof one of two things is not internally different from that of theother, I am merely thinking the same thing in different relations.Further, by the addition of one affirmation (reality) to the other, thepositive therein is really augmented, and nothing is abstracted orwithdrawn from it; hence the real in things cannot be in contradictionwith or opposition to itself—and so on.The true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of theunderstanding has, as we have shown, been so misconceived by Leibnitz,one of the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times,that he has been misled into the construction of a baseless system ofintellectual cognition, which professes to determine its objectswithout the intervention of the senses. For this reason, the expositionof the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions, as the origin ofthese false principles, is of great utility in determining withcertainty the proper limits of the understanding.It is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of aconception can be affirmed or denied of any part of it (dictum de omniet nullo); but it would be absurd so to alter this logical propositionas to say whatever is not contained in a general conception is likewisenot contained in the particular conceptions which rank under it; forthe latter are particular conceptions, for the very reason that theircontent is greater than that which is cogitated in the generalconception. And yet the whole intellectual system of Leibnitz is basedupon this false principle, and with it must necessarily fall to theground, together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to theemployment of the understanding which have thence originated.Leibnitz’s principle of the identity of indiscernibles orindistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that, if inthe conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found, itis also not to be met with in things themselves; that, consequently,all things are completely identical (numero eadem) which are notdistinguishable from each other (as to quality or quantity) in ourconceptions of them. But, as in the mere conception of anythingabstraction has been made of many necessary conditions of intuition,that of which abstraction has been made is rashly held to benon-existent, and nothing is attributed to the thing but what iscontained in its conception.The conception of a cubic foot of space, however I may think it, is initself completely identical. But two cubic feet in space arenevertheless distinct from each other from the sole fact of their beingin different places (they are numero diversa); and these places areconditions of intuition, wherein the object of this conception isgiven, and which do not belong to the conception, but to the faculty ofsensibility. In like manner, there is in the conception of a thing nocontradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative; andmerely affirmative conceptions cannot, in conjunction, produce anynegation. But in sensuous intuition, wherein reality (take for example,motion) is given, we find conditions (opposite directions)—of whichabstraction has been made in the conception of motion in general—whichrender possible a contradiction or opposition (not indeed of a logicalkind)—and which from pure positives produce zero = 0. We are thereforenot justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement andharmony, because no contradiction is discoverable among itsconceptions.[39] According to mere conceptions, that which is internalis the substratum of all relations or external determinations. When,therefore, I abstract all conditions of intuition, and confine myselfsolely to the conception of a thing in general, I can make abstractionof all external relations, and there must nevertheless remain aconception of that which indicates no relation, but merely internaldeterminations. Now it seems to follow that in everything (substance)there is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes allexternal determinations, inasmuch as it renders them possible; and thattherefore this substratum is something which does not contain anyexternal relations and is consequently simple (for corporeal things arenever anything but relations, at least of their parts external to eachother); and, inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internaldeterminations than those of the internal sense, this substratum is notonly simple, but also, analogously with our internal sense, determinedthrough representations, that is to say, all things are properlymonads, or simple beings endowed with the power of representation. Nowall this would be perfectly correct, if the conception of a thing werethe only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of externalintuition. It is, on the contrary, manifest that a permanent phenomenonin space (impenetrable extension) can contain mere relations, andnothing that is absolutely internal, and yet be the primary substratumof all external perception. By mere conceptions I cannot think anythingexternal, without, at the same time, thinking something internal, forthe reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things, andwithout these are impossible. But, as an intuition there is something(that is, space, which, with all it contains, consists of purelyformal, or, indeed, real relations) which is not found in the mereconception of a thing in general, and this presents to us thesubstratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone, Icannot say: because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptionswithout something absolutely internal, there is also, in the thingsthemselves which are contained under these conceptions, and in theirintuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal doesnot serve as the foundation. For, when we have made abstraction of allthe conditions of intuition, there certainly remains in the mereconception nothing but the internal in general, through which alone theexternal is possible. But this necessity, which is grounded uponabstraction alone, does not obtain in the case of things themselves, inso far as they are given in intuition with such determinations asexpress mere relations, without having anything internal as theirfoundation; for they are not things of a thing of which we can neitherfor they are not things in themselves, but only phenomena. What wecognize in matter is nothing but relations (what we call its internaldeterminations are but comparatively internal). But there are someself-subsistent and permanent, through which a determined object isgiven. That I, when abstraction is made of these relations, havenothing more to think, does not destroy the conception of a thing asphenomenon, nor the conception of an object in abstracto, but it doesaway with the possibility of an object that is determinable accordingto mere conceptions, that is, of a noumenon. It is certainly startlingto hear that a thing consists solely of relations; but this thing issimply a phenomenon, and cannot be cogitated by means of the merecategories: it does itself consist in the mere relation of something ingeneral to the senses. In the same way, we cannot cogitate relations ofthings in abstracto, if we commence with conceptions alone, in anyother manner than that one is the cause of determinations in the other;for that is itself the conception of the understanding or category ofrelation. But, as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition, welose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines to each ofits parts its place, that is, the form of sensibility (space); and yetthis mode antecedes all empirical causality. [39] If any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge, and to say, that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition to each other, it will be requisite for him to adduce an example of this pure and non-sensuous reality, that it may be understood whether the notion represents something or nothing. But an example cannot be found except in experience, which never presents to us anything more than phenomena; and thus the proposition means nothing more than that the conception which contains only affirmatives does not contain anything negative—a proposition nobody ever doubted.If by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought bymeans of the pure categories, without the need of the schemata ofsensibility, such objects are impossible. For the condition of theobjective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode ofour sensuous intuition, whereby objects are given; and, if we makeabstraction of the latter, the former can have no relation to anobject. And even if we should suppose a different kind of intuitionfrom our own, still our functions of thought would have no use orsignification in respect thereof. But if we understand by the term,objects of a non-sensuous intuition, in respect of which our categoriesare not valid, and of which we can accordingly have no knowledge(neither intuition nor conception), in this merely negative sensenoumena must be admitted. For this is no more than saying that our modeof intuition is not applicable to all things, but only to objects ofour senses, that consequently its objective validity is limited, andthat room is therefore left for another kind of intuition, and thusalso for things that may be objects of it. But in this sense theconception of a noumenon is problematical, that is to say, it is thenotion of that it that it is possible, nor that it is impossible,inasmuch as we do not know of any mode of intuition besides thesensuous, or of any other sort of conceptions than the categories—amode of intuition and a kind of conception neither of which isapplicable to a non-sensuous object. We are on this account incompetentto extend the sphere of our objects of thought beyond the conditions ofour sensibility, and to assume the existence of objects of purethought, that is, of noumena, inasmuch as these have no true positivesignification. For it must be confessed of the categories that they arenot of themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselvesand, without the data of sensibility, are mere subjective forms of theunity of the understanding. Thought is certainly not a product of thesenses, and in so far is not limited by them, but it does not thereforefollow that it may be employed purely and without the intervention ofsensibility, for it would then be without reference to an object. Andwe cannot call a noumenon an object of pure thought; for therepresentation thereof is but the problematical conception of an objectfor a perfectly different intuition and a perfectly differentunderstanding from ours, both of which are consequently themselvesproblematical. The conception of a noumenon is therefore not theconception of an object, but merely a problematical conceptioninseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility. That isto say, this conception contains the answer to the question: “Are thereobjects quite unconnected with, and independent of, our intuition?”—aquestion to which only an indeterminate answer can be given. Thatanswer is: “Inasmuch as sensuous intuition does not apply to all thingswithout distinction, there remains room for other and differentobjects.” The existence of these problematical objects is therefore notabsolutely denied, in the absence of a determinate conception of them,but, as no category is valid in respect of them, neither must they beadmitted as objects for our understanding.Understanding accordingly limits sensibility, without at the same timeenlarging its own field. While, moreover, it forbids sensibility toapply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it tothe sphere of phenomena, it cogitates an object in itself, only,however, as a transcendental object, which is the cause of a phenomenon(consequently not itself a phenomenon), and which cannot be thoughteither as a quantity or as reality, or as substance (because theseconceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine anobject)—an object, therefore, of which we are quite unable to saywhether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us, whether it wouldbe annihilated together with sensibility, or, if this were taken away,would continue to exist. If we wish to call this object a noumenon,because the representation of it is non-sensuous, we are at liberty todo so. But as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of ourunderstanding, the representation is for us quite void, and isavailable only for the indication of the limits of our sensuousintuition, thereby leaving at the same time an empty space, which weare competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience, nor ofthe pure understanding.The critique of the pure understanding, accordingly, does not permit usto create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which arepresented to us as phenomena, and to stray into intelligible worlds;nay, it does not even allow us to endeavour to form so much as aconception of them. The specious error which leads to this—and which isa perfectly excusable one—lies in the fact that the employment of theunderstanding, contrary to its proper purpose and destination, is madetranscendental, and objects, that is, possible intuitions, are made toregulate themselves according to conceptions, instead of theconceptions arranging themselves according to the intuitions, on whichalone their own objective validity rests. Now the reason of this againis that apperception, and with it thought, antecedes all possibledeterminate arrangement of representations. Accordingly we thinksomething in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously, but,on the other, distinguish the general and in abstracto representedobject from this particular mode of intuiting it. In this case thereremains a mode of determining the object by mere thought, which isreally but a logical form without content, which, however, seems to usto be a mode of the existence of the object in itself (noumenon),without regard to intuition which is limited to our senses.Before ending this transcendental analytic, we must make an addition,which, although in itself of no particular importance, seems to benecessary to the completeness of the system. The highest conception,with which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins, is the divisioninto possible and impossible. But as all division presupposes a dividedconception, a still higher one must exist, and this is the conceptionof an object in general—problematically understood and without itsbeing decided whether it is something or nothing. As the categories arethe only conceptions which apply to objects in general, thedistinguishing of an object, whether it is something or nothing, mustproceed according to the order and direction of the categories.1. To the categories of quantity, that is, the conceptions of all,many, and one, the conception which annihilates all, that is, theconception of none, is opposed. And thus the object of a conception, towhich no intuition can be found to correspond, is = nothing. That is,it is a conception without an object (ens rationis), like noumena,which cannot be considered possible in the sphere of reality, thoughthey must not therefore be held to be impossible—or like certain newfundamental forces in matter, the existence of which is cogitablewithout contradiction, though, as examples from experience are notforthcoming, they must not be regarded as possible.2. Reality is something; negation is nothing, that is, a conception ofthe absence of an object, as cold, a shadow (nihil privativum).3. The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself noobject, but the merely formal condition of an object (as phenomenon),as pure space and pure time. These are certainly something, as forms ofintuition, but are not themselves objects which are intuited (ensimaginarium).4. The object of a conception which is self-contradictory, is nothing,because the conception is nothing—is impossible, as a figure composedof two straight lines (nihil negativum).The table of this division of the conception of nothing (thecorresponding division of the conception of something does not requirespecial description) must therefore be arranged as follows:                      NOTHING                        AS                        1                As Empty Conception                 without object,                  _ens rationis_           2                               3     Empty object of               Empty intuition      a conception,                without object,     _nihil privativum              ens imaginarium_                        4                   Empty object                 without conception,                  _nihil negativum_We see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativumor pure nothing by the consideration that the former must not bereckoned among possibilities, because it is a mere fiction—though notself-contradictory, while the latter is completely opposed to allpossibility, inasmuch as the conception annihilates itself. Both,however, are empty conceptions. On the other hand, the nihil privativumand ens imaginarium are empty data for conceptions. If light be notgiven to the senses, we cannot represent to ourselves darkness, and ifextended objects are not perceived, we cannot represent space. Neitherthe negation, nor the mere form of intuition can, without somethingreal, be an object.SECOND DIVISION—TRANSCENDENTAL LOGICTRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC.INTRODUCTION.I. Of Transcendental Illusory AppearanceWe termed dialectic in general a logic of appearance. This does notsignify a doctrine of probability; for probability is truth, onlycognized upon insufficient grounds, and though the information it givesus is imperfect, it is not therefore deceitful. Hence it must not beseparated from the analytical part of logic. Still less must phenomenonand appearance be held to be identical. For truth or illusoryappearance does not reside in the object, in so far as it is intuited,but in the judgement upon the object, in so far as it is thought. Itis, therefore, quite correct to say that the senses do not err, notbecause they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge atall. Hence truth and error, consequently also, illusory appearance asthe cause of error, are only to be found in a judgement, that is, inthe relation of an object to our understanding. In a cognition whichcompletely harmonizes with the laws of the understanding, no error canexist. In a representation of the senses—as not containing anyjudgement—there is also no error. But no power of nature can of itselfdeviate from its own laws. Hence neither the understanding per se(without the influence of another cause), nor the senses per se, wouldfall into error; the former could not, because, if it acts onlyaccording to its own laws, the effect (the judgement) must necessarilyaccord with these laws. But in accordance with the laws of theunderstanding consists the formal element in all truth. In the sensesthere is no judgement—neither a true nor a false one. But, as we haveno source of cognition besides these two, it follows that error iscaused solely by the unobserved influence of the sensibility upon theunderstanding. And thus it happens that the subjective grounds of ajudgement and are confounded with the objective, and cause them todeviate from their proper determination,[40] just as a body in motionwould always of itself proceed in a straight line, but if anotherimpetus gives to it a different direction, it will then start off intoa curvilinear line of motion. To distinguish the peculiar action of theunderstanding from the power which mingles with it, it is necessary toconsider an erroneous judgement as the diagonal between two forces,that determine the judgement in two different directions, which, as itwere, form an angle, and to resolve this composite operation into thesimple ones of the understanding and the sensibility. In pure à priorijudgements this must be done by means of transcendental reflection,whereby, as has been already shown, each representation has its placeappointed in the corresponding faculty of cognition, and consequentlythe influence of the one faculty upon the other is made apparent. [40] Sensibility, subjected to the understanding, as the object upon which the understanding employs its functions, is the source of real cognitions. But, in so far as it exercises an influence upon the action of the understanding and determines it to judgement, sensibility is itself the cause of error.It is not at present our business to treat of empirical illusoryappearance (for example, optical illusion), which occurs in theempirical application of otherwise correct rules of the understanding,and in which the judgement is misled by the influence of imagination.Our purpose is to speak of transcendental illusory appearance, whichinfluences principles—that are not even applied to experience, for inthis case we should possess a sure test of their correctness—but whichleads us, in disregard of all the warnings of criticism, completelybeyond the empirical employment of the categories and deludes us withthe chimera of an extension of the sphere of the pure understanding. Weshall term those principles the application of which is confinedentirely within the limits of possible experience, immanent; those, onthe other hand, which transgress these limits, we shall calltranscendent principles. But by these latter I do not understandprinciples of the transcendental use or misuse of the categories, whichis in reality a mere fault of the judgement when not under duerestraint from criticism, and therefore not paying sufficient attentionto the limits of the sphere in which the pure understanding is allowedto exercise its functions; but real principles which exhort us to breakdown all those barriers, and to lay claim to a perfectly new field ofcognition, which recognizes no line of demarcation. Thus transcendentaland transcendent are not identical terms. The principles of the pureunderstanding, which we have already propounded, ought to be ofempirical and not of transcendental use, that is, they are notapplicable to any object beyond the sphere of experience. A principlewhich removes these limits, nay, which authorizes us to overstep them,is called transcendent. If our criticism can succeed in exposing theillusion in these pretended principles, those which are limited intheir employment to the sphere of experience may be called, inopposition to the others, immanent principles of the pureunderstanding.Logical illusion, which consists merely in the imitation of the form ofreason (the illusion in sophistical syllogisms), arises entirely from awant of due attention to logical rules. So soon as the attention isawakened to the case before us, this illusion totally disappears.Transcendental illusion, on the contrary, does not cease to exist, evenafter it has been exposed, and its nothingness clearly perceived bymeans of transcendental criticism. Take, for example, the illusion inthe proposition: “The world must have a beginning in time.” The causeof this is as follows. In our reason, subjectively considered as afaculty of human cognition, there exist fundamental rules and maxims ofits exercise, which have completely the appearance of objectiveprinciples. Now from this cause it happens that the subjectivenecessity of a certain connection of our conceptions, is regarded as anobjective necessity of the determination of things in themselves. Thisillusion it is impossible to avoid, just as we cannot avoid perceivingthat the sea appears to be higher at a distance than it is near theshore, because we see the former by means of higher rays than thelatter, or, which is a still stronger case, as even the astronomercannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising thansome time afterwards, although he is not deceived by this illusion.Transcendental dialectic will therefore content itself with exposingthe illusory appearance in transcendental judgements, and guarding usagainst it; but to make it, as in the case of logical illusion,entirely disappear and cease to be illusion is utterly beyond itspower. For we have here to do with a natural and unavoidable illusion,which rests upon subjective principles and imposes these upon us asobjective, while logical dialectic, in the detection of sophisms, hasto do merely with an error in the logical consequence of thepropositions, or with an artificially constructed illusion, inimitation of the natural error. There is, therefore, a natural andunavoidable dialectic of pure reason—not that in which the bungler,from want of the requisite knowledge, involves himself, nor that whichthe sophist devises for the purpose of misleading, but that which is aninseparable adjunct of human reason, and which, even after itsillusions have been exposed, does not cease to deceive, and continuallyto lead reason into momentary errors, which it becomes necessarycontinually to remove.II. Of Pure Reason as the Seat of Transcendental Illusory AppearanceA. OF REASON IN GENERAL.All our knowledge begins with sense, proceeds thence to understanding,and ends with reason, beyond which nothing higher can be discovered inthe human mind for elaborating the matter of intuition and subjectingit to the highest unity of thought. At this stage of our inquiry it ismy duty to give an explanation of this, the highest faculty ofcognition, and I confess I find myself here in some difficulty. Ofreason, as of the understanding, there is a merely formal, that is,logical use, in which it makes abstraction of all content of cognition;but there is also a real use, inasmuch as it contains in itself thesource of certain conceptions and principles, which it does not borroweither from the senses or the understanding. The former faculty hasbeen long defined by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusion incontradistinction to immediate conclusions (consequentiae immediatae);but the nature of the latter, which itself generates conceptions, isnot to be understood from this definition. Now as a division of reasoninto a logical and a transcendental faculty presents itself here, itbecomes necessary to seek for a higher conception of this source ofcognition which shall comprehend both conceptions. In this we mayexpect, according to the analogy of the conceptions of theunderstanding, that the logical conception will give us the key to thetranscendental, and that the table of the functions of the former willpresent us with the clue to the conceptions of reason.In the former part of our transcendental logic, we defined theunderstanding to be the faculty of rules; reason may be distinguishedfrom understanding as the faculty of principles.The term principle is ambiguous, and commonly signifies merely acognition that may be employed as a principle, although it is not initself, and as regards its proper origin, entitled to the distinction.Every general proposition, even if derived from experience by theprocess of induction, may serve as the major in a syllogism; but it isnot for that reason a principle. Mathematical axioms (for example,there can be only one straight line between two points) are general àpriori cognitions, and are therefore rightly denominated principles,relatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them. But I cannotfor this reason say that I cognize this property of a straight linefrom principles—I cognize it only in pure intuition.Cognition from principles, then, is that cognition in which I cognizethe particular in the general by means of conceptions. Thus everysyllogism is a form of the deduction of a cognition from a principle.For the major always gives a conception, through which everything thatis subsumed under the condition thereof is cognized according to aprinciple. Now as every general cognition may serve as the major in asyllogism, and the understanding presents us with such general à prioripropositions, they may be termed principles, in respect of theirpossible use.But if we consider these principles of the pure understanding inrelation to their origin, we shall find them to be anything rather thancognitions from conceptions. For they would not even be possible àpriori, if we could not rely on the assistance of pure intuition (inmathematics), or on that of the conditions of a possible experience.That everything that happens has a cause, cannot be concluded from thegeneral conception of that which happens; on the contrary the principleof causality instructs us as to the mode of obtaining from that whichhappens a determinate empirical conception.Synthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannotsupply, and they alone are entitled to be called principles. At thesame time, all general propositions may be termed comparativeprinciples.It has been a long-cherished wish—that (who knows how late), may oneday, be happily accomplished—that the principles of the endless varietyof civil laws should be investigated and exposed; for in this way alonecan we find the secret of simplifying legislation. But in this case,laws are nothing more than limitations of our freedom upon conditionsunder which it subsists in perfect harmony with itself; theyconsequently have for their object that which is completely our ownwork, and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means of theseconceptions. But how objects as things in themselves—how the nature ofthings is subordinated to principles and is to be determined, accordingto conceptions, is a question which it seems well nigh impossible toanswer. Be this, however, as it may—for on this point our investigationis yet to be made—it is at least manifest from what we have said thatcognition from principles is something very different from cognition bymeans of the understanding, which may indeed precede other cognitionsin the form of a principle, but in itself—in so far as it issynthetical—is neither based upon mere thought, nor contains a generalproposition drawn from conceptions alone.The understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity ofphenomena by virtue of rules; the reason is a faculty for theproduction of unity of rules (of the understanding) under principles.Reason, therefore, never applies directly to experience, or to anysensuous object; its object is, on the contrary, the understanding, tothe manifold cognition of which it gives a unity à priori by means ofconceptions—a unity which may be called rational unity, and which is ofa nature very different from that of the unity produced by theunderstanding.The above is the general conception of the faculty of reason, in so faras it has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence ofexamples. These will be given in the sequel.B. OF THE LOGICAL USE OF REASON.A distinction is commonly made between that which is immediatelycognized and that which is inferred or concluded. That in a figurewhich is bounded by three straight lines there are three angles, is animmediate cognition; but that these angles are together equal to tworight angles, is an inference or conclusion. Now, as we are constantlyemploying this mode of thought and have thus become quite accustomed toit, we no longer remark the above distinction, and, as in the case ofthe so-called deceptions of sense, consider as immediately perceived,what has really been inferred. In every reasoning or syllogism, thereis a fundamental proposition, afterwards a second drawn from it, andfinally the conclusion, which connects the truth in the first with thetruth in the second—and that infallibly. If the judgement concluded isso contained in the first proposition that it can be deduced from itwithout the meditation of a third notion, the conclusion is calledimmediate (consequentia immediata); I prefer the term conclusion of theunderstanding. But if, in addition to the fundamental cognition, asecond judgement is necessary for the production of the conclusion, itis called a conclusion of the reason. In the proposition: All men aremortal, are contained the propositions: Some men are mortal, Nothingthat is not mortal is a man, and these are therefore immediateconclusions from the first. On the other hand, the proposition: all thelearned are mortal, is not contained in the main proposition (for theconception of a learned man does not occur in it), and it can bededuced from the main proposition only by means of a mediatingjudgement.In every syllogism I first cogitate a rule (the major) by means of theunderstanding. In the next place I subsume a cognition under thecondition of the rule (and this is the minor) by means of thejudgement. And finally I determine my cognition by means of thepredicate of the rule (this is the conclusio), consequently, Idetermine it à priori by means of the reason. The relations, therefore,which the major proposition, as the rule, represents between acognition and its condition, constitute the different kinds ofsyllogisms. These are just threefold—analogously with all judgements,in so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of acognition in the understanding—namely, categorical, hypothetical, anddisjunctive.When as often happens, the conclusion is a judgement which may followfrom other given judgements, through which a perfectly different objectis cogitated, I endeavour to discover in the understanding whether theassertion in this conclusion does not stand under certain conditionsaccording to a general rule. If I find such a condition, and if theobject mentioned in the conclusion can be subsumed under the givencondition, then this conclusion follows from a rule which is also validfor other objects of cognition. From this we see that reason endeavoursto subject the great variety of the cognitions of the understanding tothe smallest possible number of principles (general conditions), andthus to produce in it the highest unity.C. OF THE PURE USE OF REASON.Can we isolate reason, and, if so, is it in this case a peculiar sourceof conceptions and judgements which spring from it alone, and throughwhich it can be applied to objects; or is it merely a subordinatefaculty, whose duty it is to give a certain form to given cognitions—aform which is called logical, and through which the cognitions of theunderstanding are subordinated to each other, and lower rules to higher(those, to wit, whose condition comprises in its sphere the conditionof the others), in so far as this can be done by comparison? This isthe question which we have at present to answer. Manifold variety ofrules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason, for thepurpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance withitself, just as understanding subjects the manifold content ofintuition to conceptions, and thereby introduces connection into it.But this principle prescribes no law to objects, and does not containany ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them assuch, but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of thecontent of the understanding. The purpose of this law is, by acomparison of the conceptions of the understanding, to reduce them tothe smallest possible number, although, at the same time, it does notjustify us in demanding from objects themselves such a uniformity asmight contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphereof the understanding, or in expecting that it will itself thus receivefrom them objective validity. In one word, the question is: “doesreason in itself, that is, does pure reason contain à priorisynthetical principles and rules, and what are those principles?”The formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives ussufficient information in regard to the ground on which thetranscendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognitionwill rest.1. Reason, as observed in the syllogistic process, is not applicable tointuitions, for the purpose of subjecting them to rules—for this is theprovince of the understanding with its categories—but to conceptionsand judgements. If pure reason does apply to objects and the intuitionof them, it does so not immediately, but mediately—through theunderstanding and its judgements, which have a direct relation to thesenses and their intuition, for the purpose of determining theirobjects. The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possibleexperience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is thatof the understanding. That everything which happens has a cause, is nota principle cognized and prescribed by reason. This principle makes theunity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason, which,without a reference to possible experience, could never have producedby means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity.2. Reason, in its logical use, endeavours to discover the generalcondition of its judgement (the conclusion), and a syllogism is itselfnothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its conditionunder a general rule (the major). Now as this rule may itself besubjected to the same process of reason, and thus the condition of thecondition be sought (by means of a prosyllogism) as long as the processcan be continued, it is very manifest that the peculiar principle ofreason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition ofthe understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former iscompleted.But this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason, unless weadmit that, if the conditioned is given, the whole series of conditionssubordinated to one another—a series which is consequently itselfunconditioned—is also given, that is, contained in the object and itsconnection.But this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical; for,analytically, the conditioned certainly relates to some condition, butnot to the unconditioned. From this principle also there must originatedifferent synthetical propositions, of which the pure understanding isperfectly ignorant, for it has to do only with objects of a possibleexperience, the cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned.The unconditioned, if it does really exist, must be especiallyconsidered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it fromwhatever is conditioned, and will thus afford us material for many àpriori synthetical propositions.The principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reasonwill, however, be transcendent in relation to phenomena, that is tosay, it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of thisprinciple. It is therefore completely different from all principles ofthe understanding, the use made of which is entirely immanent, theirobject and purpose being merely the possibility of experience. Now ourduty in the transcendental dialectic is as follows. To discover whetherthe principle that the series of conditions (in the synthesis ofphenomena, or of thought in general) extends to the unconditioned isobjectively true, or not; what consequences result therefrom affectingthe empirical use of the understanding, or rather whether there existsany such objectively valid proposition of reason, and whether it isnot, on the contrary, a merely logical precept which directs us toascend perpetually to still higher conditions, to approach completenessin the series of them, and thus to introduce into our cognition thehighest possible unity of reason. We must ascertain, I say, whetherthis requirement of reason has not been regarded, by amisunderstanding, as a transcendental principle of pure reason, whichpostulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions inobjects themselves. We must show, moreover, the misconceptions andillusions that intrude into syllogisms, the major proposition of whichpure reason has supplied—a proposition which has perhaps more of thecharacter of a petitio than of a postulatum—and that proceed fromexperience upwards to its conditions. The solution of these problems isour task in transcendental dialectic, which we are about to expose evenat its source, that lies deep in human reason. We shall divide it intotwo parts, the first of which will treat of the transcendentconceptions of pure reason, the second of transcendent and dialecticalsyllogisms.TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC—BOOK I—OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF PURE REASON.The conceptions of pure reason—we do not here speak of the possibilityof them—are not obtained by reflection, but by inference or conclusion.The conceptions of understanding are also cogitated à prioriantecedently to experience, and render it possible; but they containnothing but the unity of reflection upon phenomena, in so far as thesemust necessarily belong to a possible empirical consciousness. Throughthem alone are cognition and the determination of an object possible.It is from them, accordingly, that we receive material for reasoning,and antecedently to them we possess no à priori conceptions of objectsfrom which they might be deduced, On the other hand, the sole basis oftheir objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on them, ascontaining the intellectual form of all experience, of restrictingtheir application and influence to the sphere of experience.But the term, conception of reason, or rational conception, itselfindicates that it does not confine itself within the limits ofexperience, because its object-matter is a cognition, of which everyempirical cognition is but a part—nay, the whole of possible experiencemay be itself but a part of it—a cognition to which no actualexperience ever fully attains, although it does always pertain to it.The aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension, as that of theconceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions. Ifthey contain the unconditioned, they relate to that to which allexperience is subordinate, but which is never itself an object ofexperience—that towards which reason tends in all its conclusions fromexperience, and by the standard of which it estimates the degree oftheir empirical use, but which is never itself an element in anempirical synthesis. If, notwithstanding, such conceptions possessobjective validity, they may be called conceptus ratiocinati(conceptions legitimately concluded); in cases where they do not, theyhave been admitted on account of having the appearance of beingcorrectly concluded, and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes(sophistical conceptions). But as this can only be sufficientlydemonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to thedialectical conclusions of reason, we shall omit any consideration ofit in this place. As we called the pure conceptions of theunderstanding categories, we shall also distinguish those of purereason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas. These terms,however, we must in the first place explain and justify.Section I—Of Ideas in GeneralDespite the great wealth of words which European languages possess, thethinker finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suitedto his conception, for want of which he is unable to make himselfintelligible either to others or to himself. To coin new words is apretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful; and,before recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient, it is advisableto examine the dead and learned languages, with the hope and theprobability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of thenotion we have in our minds. In this case, even if the original meaningof the word has become somewhat uncertain, from carelessness or want ofcaution on the part of the authors of it, it is always better to adhereto and confirm its proper meaning—even although it may be doubtfulwhether it was formerly used in exactly this sense—than to make ourlabour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselvesintelligible.For this reason, when it happens that there exists only a single wordto express a certain conception, and this word, in its usualacceptation, is thoroughly adequate to the conception, the accuratedistinction of which from related conceptions is of great importance,we ought not to employ the expression improvidently, or, for the sakeof variety and elegance of style, use it as a synonym for other cognatewords. It is our duty, on the contrary, carefully to preserve itspeculiar signification, as otherwise it easily happens that when theattention of the reader is no longer particularly attracted to theexpression, and it is lost amid the multitude of other words of verydifferent import, the thought which it conveyed, and which it aloneconveyed, is lost with it.Plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed hemeant by it something which is never derived from the senses, but whichfar transcends even the conceptions of the understanding (with whichAristotle occupied himself), inasmuch as in experience nothingperfectly corresponding to them could be found. Ideas are, according tohim, archetypes of things themselves, and not merely keys to possibleexperiences, like the categories. In his view they flow from thehighest reason, by which they have been imparted to human reason,which, however, exists no longer in its original state, but is obligedwith great labour to recall by reminiscence—which is calledphilosophy—the old but now sadly obscured ideas. I will not here enterupon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublimephilosopher attached to this expression. I shall content myself withremarking that it is nothing unusual, in common conversation as well asin written works, by comparing the thoughts which an author hasdelivered upon a subject, to understand him better than he understoodhimself inasmuch as he may not have sufficiently determined hisconception, and thus have sometimes spoken, nay even thought, inopposition to his own opinions.Plato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has thefeeling of a much higher vocation than that of merely spelling outphenomena according to synthetical unity, for the purpose of being ableto read them as experience, and that our reason naturally raises itselfto cognitions far too elevated to admit of the possibility of an objectgiven by experience corresponding to them—cognitions which arenevertheless real, and are not mere phantoms of the brain.This philosopher found his ideas especially in all that ispractical,[41] that is, which rests upon freedom, which in its turnranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason. He whowould derive from experience the conceptions of virtue, who would make(as many have really done) that, which at best can but serve as animperfectly illustrative example, a model for or the formation of aperfectly adequate idea on the subject, would in fact transform virtueinto a nonentity changeable according to time and circumstance andutterly incapable of being employed as a rule. On the contrary, everyone is conscious that, when any one is held up to him as a model ofvirtue, he compares this so-called model with the true original whichhe possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard.But this standard is the idea of virtue, in relation to which allpossible objects of experience are indeed serviceable asexamples—proofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that whichthe conception of virtue demands—but certainly not as archetypes. Thatthe actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all therequirements of the pure ideas of reason, does not prove the thought tobe chimerical. For only through this idea are all judgements as tomoral merit or demerit possible; it consequently lies at the foundationof every approach to moral perfection, however far removed from it theobstacles in human nature—indeterminable as to degree—may keep us. [41] He certainly extended the application of his conception to speculative cognitions also, provided they were given pure and completely à priori, nay, even to mathematics, although this science cannot possess an object otherwhere than in Possible experience. I cannot follow him in this, and as little can I follow him in his mystical deduction of these ideas, or in his hypostatization of them; although, in truth, the elevated and exaggerated language which he employed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more subdued and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things.The Platonic Republic has become proverbial as an example—and astriking one—of imaginary perfection, such as can exist only in thebrain of the idle thinker; and Brucker ridicules the philosopher formaintaining that a prince can never govern well, unless he isparticipant in the ideas. But we should do better to follow up thisthought and, where this admirable thinker leaves us without assistance,employ new efforts to place it in clearer light, rather than carelesslyfling it aside as useless, under the very miserable and perniciouspretext of impracticability. A constitution of the greatest possiblehuman freedom according to laws, by which the liberty of everyindividual can consist with the liberty of every other (not of thegreatest possible happiness, for this follows necessarily from theformer), is, to say the least, a necessary idea, which must be placedat the foundation not only of the first plan of the constitution of astate, but of all its laws. And, in this, it not necessary at theoutset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our way—obstacleswhich perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character of humannature, but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas inlegislation. For there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy ofa philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to a so-called adverseexperience, which indeed would not have existed, if those institutionshad been established at the proper time and in accordance with ideas;while, instead of this, conceptions, crude for the very reason thatthey have been drawn from experience, have marred and frustrated allour better views and intentions. The more legislation and governmentare in harmony with this idea, the more rare do punishments become andthus it is quite reasonable to maintain, as Plato did, that in aperfect state no punishments at all would be necessary. Now although aperfect state may never exist, the idea is not on that account the lessjust, which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of aconstitution, in order to bring legislative government always nearerand nearer to the greatest possible perfection. For at what precisedegree human nature must stop in its progress, and how wide must be thechasm which must necessarily exist between the idea and itsrealization, are problems which no one can or ought to determine—andfor this reason, that it is the destination of freedom to overstep allassigned limits between itself and the idea.But not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent andwhere ideas are operative causes (of actions and their objects), thatis to say, in the region of ethics, but also in regard to natureherself, Plato saw clear proofs of an origin from ideas. A plant, andanimal, the regular order of nature—probably also the disposition ofthe whole universe—give manifest evidence that they are possible onlyby means of and according to ideas; that, indeed, no one creature,under the individual conditions of its existence, perfectly harmonizeswith the idea of the most perfect of its kind—just as little as manwith the idea of humanity, which nevertheless he bears in his soul asthe archetypal standard of his actions; that, notwithstanding, theseideas are in the highest sense individually, unchangeably, andcompletely determined, and are the original causes of things; and thatthe totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fullyadequate to that idea. Setting aside the exaggerations of expression inthe writings of this philosopher, the mental power exhibited in thisascent from the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to thearchitectonic connection thereof according to ends, that is, ideas, isan effort which deserves imitation and claims respect. But as regardsthe principles of ethics, of legislation, and of religion, spheres inwhich ideas alone render experience possible, although they neverattain to full expression therein, he has vindicated for himself aposition of peculiar merit, which is not appreciated only because it isjudged by the very empirical rules, the validity of which as principlesis destroyed by ideas. For as regards nature, experience presents uswith rules and is the source of truth, but in relation to ethical lawsexperience is the parent of illusion, and it is in the highest degreereprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what I oughtto do, from what is done.We must, however, omit the consideration of these important subjects,the development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity ofphilosophy, and confine ourselves for the present to the more humblebut not less useful task of preparing a firm foundation for thosemajestic edifices of moral science. For this foundation has beenhitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason inits confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions.Our present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with thetranscendental use made of pure reason, its principles and ideas, thatwe may be able properly to determine and value its influence and realworth. But before bringing these introductory remarks to a close, I begthose who really have philosophy at heart—and their number is butsmall—if they shall find themselves convinced by the considerationsfollowing as well as by those above, to exert themselves to preserve tothe expression idea its original signification, and to take care thatit be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts ofrepresentations are loosely designated—that the interests of sciencemay not thereby suffer. We are in no want of words to denominateadequately every mode of representation, without the necessity ofencroaching upon terms which are proper to others. The following is agraduated list of them. The genus is representation in general(representatio). Under it stands representation with consciousness(perceptio). A perception which relates solely to the subject as amodification of its state, is a sensation (sensatio), an objectiveperception is a cognition (cognitio). A cognition is either anintuition or a conception (intuitus vel conceptus). The former has animmediate relation to the object and is singular and individual; thelatter has but a mediate relation, by means of a characteristic markwhich may be common to several things. A conception is either empiricalor pure. A pure conception, in so far as it has its origin in theunderstanding alone, and is not the conception of a pure sensuousimage, is called notio. A conception formed from notions, whichtranscends the possibility of experience, is an idea, or a conceptionof reason. To one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions, itmust be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour redcalled an idea. It ought not even to be called a notion or conceptionof understanding.Section II. Of Transcendental IdeasTranscendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of ourcognition can contain the origin of pure conceptions à priori,conceptions which represent objects antecedently to all experience, orrather, indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible anempirical cognition of objects. The form of judgements—converted into aconception of the synthesis of intuitions—produced the categories whichdirect the employment of the understanding in experience. Thisconsideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms, whenapplied to synthetical unity of intuitions, following the rule of thecategories, will contain the origin of particular à priori conceptions,which we may call pure conceptions of reason or transcendental ideas,and which will determine the use of the understanding in the totalityof experience according to principles.The function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of acognition according to conceptions, and the syllogism itself is ajudgement which is determined à priori in the whole extent of itscondition. The proposition: “Caius is mortal,” is one which may beobtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone; but mywish is to find a conception which contains the condition under whichthe predicate of this judgement is given—in this case, the conceptionof man—and after subsuming under this condition, taken in its wholeextent (all men are mortal), I determine according to it the cognitionof the object thought, and say: “Caius is mortal.”Hence, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to acertain object, after having thought it in the major in its wholeextent under a certain condition. This complete quantity of the extentin relation to such a condition is called universality (universalitas).To this corresponds totality (universitas) of conditions in thesynthesis of intuitions. The transcendental conception of reason istherefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of theconditions of a given conditioned. Now as the unconditioned alonerenders possible totality of conditions, and, conversely, the totalityof conditions is itself always unconditioned; a pure rationalconception in general can be defined and explained by means of theconception of the unconditioned, in so far as it contains a basis forthe synthesis of the conditioned.To the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates bymeans of the categories, the number of pure rational conceptions willcorrespond. We must therefore seek for, first, an unconditioned of thecategorical synthesis in a subject; secondly, of the hypotheticalsynthesis of the members of a series; thirdly, of the disjunctivesynthesis of parts in a system.There are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms, each of whichproceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditioned—one to the subjectwhich cannot be employed as predicate, another to the presuppositionwhich supposes nothing higher than itself, and the third to anaggregate of the members of the complete division of a conception.Hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis ofconditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reason—atleast as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to theunconditioned. They may have no valid application, corresponding totheir transcendental employment, in concreto, and be thus of no greaterutility than to direct the understanding how, while extending them aswidely as possible, to maintain its exercise and application in perfectconsistence and harmony.But, while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of theunconditioned as the common title of all conceptions of reason, weagain light upon an expression which we find it impossible to dispensewith, and which nevertheless, owing to the ambiguity attaching to itfrom long abuse, we cannot employ with safety. The word absolute is oneof the few words which, in its original signification, was perfectlyadequate to the conception it was intended to convey—a conception whichno other word in the same language exactly suits, and the loss—or,which is the same thing, the incautious and loose employment—of whichmust be followed by the loss of the conception itself. And, as it is aconception which occupies much of the attention of reason, its losswould be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy. Theword absolute is at present frequently used to denote that somethingcan be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically. Inthis sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible initself (interne)—which is, in fact, the least that one can predicate ofan object. On the other hand, it is sometimes employed to indicate thata thing is valid in all respects—for example, absolute sovereignty.Absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possiblein all relations and in every respect; and this is the most that can bepredicated of the possibility of a thing. Now these significations doin truth frequently coincide. Thus, for example, that which isintrinsically impossible, is also impossible in all relations, that is,absolutely impossible. But in most cases they differ from each othertoto caelo, and I can by no means conclude that, because a thing is initself possible, it is also possible in all relations, and thereforeabsolutely. Nay, more, I shall in the sequel show that absolutenecessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity, and that,therefore, it must not be considered as synonymous with it. Of anopposite which is intrinsically impossible, we may affirm that it is inall respects impossible, and that, consequently, the thing itself, ofwhich this is the opposite, is absolutely necessary; but I cannotreason conversely and say, the opposite of that which is absolutelynecessary is intrinsically impossible, that is, that the absolutenecessity of things is an internal necessity. For this internalnecessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the leastconception cannot be connected, while the conception of the necessityof a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations. Nowas the loss of a conception of great utility in speculative sciencecannot be a matter of indifference to the philosopher, I trust that theproper determination and careful preservation of the expression onwhich the conception depends will likewise be not indifferent to him.In this enlarged signification, then, shall I employ the word absolute,in opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect;for the latter is restricted by conditions, the former is valid withoutany restriction whatever.Now the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothingelse than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does notrest satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely, that is, in allrespects and relations, unconditioned. For pure reason leaves to theunderstanding everything that immediately relates to the object ofintuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination. The formerrestricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of theconceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out thesynthetical unity which is cogitated in the category, even to theunconditioned. This unity may hence be called the rational unity ofphenomena, as the other, which the category expresses, may be termedthe unity of the understanding. Reason, therefore, has an immediaterelation to the use of the understanding, not indeed in so far as thelatter contains the ground of possible experience (for the conceptionof the absolute totality of conditions is not a conception that can beemployed in experience, because no experience is unconditioned), butsolely for the purpose of directing it to a certain unity, of which theunderstanding has no conception, and the aim of which is to collectinto an absolute whole all acts of the understanding. Hence theobjective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is alwaystranscendent, while that of the pure conceptions of the understandingmust, according to their nature, be always immanent, inasmuch as theyare limited to possible experience.I understand by idea a necessary conception of reason, to which nocorresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense.Accordingly, the pure conceptions of reason at present underconsideration are transcendental ideas. They are conceptions of purereason, for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by meansof an absolute totality of conditions. They are not mere fictions, butnatural and necessary products of reason, and have hence a necessaryrelation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding. And,finally, they are transcendent, and overstep the limits of allexperiences, in which, consequently, no object can ever be presentedthat would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea. When we usethe word idea, we say, as regards its object (an object of the pureunderstanding), a great deal, but as regards its subject (that is, inrespect of its reality under conditions of experience), exceedinglylittle, because the idea, as the conception of a maximum, can never becompletely and adequately presented in concreto. Now, as in the merelyspeculative employment of reason the latter is properly the sole aim,and as in this case the approximation to a conception, which is neverattained in practice, is the same thing as if the conception werenon-existent—it is commonly said of the conception of this kind, “it isonly an idea.” So we might very well say, “the absolute totality of allphenomena is only an idea,” for, as we never can present an adequaterepresentation of it, it remains for us a problem incapable ofsolution. On the other hand, as in the practical use of theunderstanding we have only to do with action and practice according torules, an idea of pure reason can always be given really in concreto,although only partially, nay, it is the indispensable condition of allpractical employment of reason. The practice or execution of the ideais always limited and defective, but nevertheless within indeterminableboundaries, consequently always under the influence of the conceptionof an absolute perfection. And thus the practical idea is always in thehighest degree fruitful, and in relation to real actions indispensablynecessary. In the idea, pure reason possesses even causality and thepower of producing that which its conception contains. Hence we cannotsay of wisdom, in a disparaging way, “it is only an idea.” For, for thevery reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possibleaims, it must be for all practical exertions and endeavours theprimitive condition and rule—a rule which, if not constitutive, is atleast limitative.Now, although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason,“they are only ideas,” we must not, on this account, look upon them assuperfluous and nugatory. For, although no object can be determined bythem, they can be of great utility, unobserved and at the basis of theedifice of the understanding, as the canon for its extended andself-consistent exercise—a canon which, indeed, does not enable it tocognize more in an object than it would cognize by the help of its ownconceptions, but which guides it more securely in its cognition. Not tomention that they perhaps render possible a transition from ourconceptions of nature and the non-ego to the practical conceptions, andthus produce for even ethical ideas keeping, so to speak, andconnection with the speculative cognitions of reason. The explicationof all this must be looked for in the sequel.But setting aside, in conformity with our original purpose, theconsideration of the practical ideas, we proceed to contemplate reasonin its speculative use alone, nay, in a still more restricted sphere,to wit, in the transcendental use; and here must strike into the samepath which we followed in our deduction of the categories. That is tosay, we shall consider the logical form of the cognition of reason,that we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source ofconceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves asdetermined synthetically à priori, in relation to one or other of thefunctions of reason.Reason, considered as the faculty of a certain logical form ofcognition, is the faculty of conclusion, that is, of mediatejudgement—by means of the subsumption of the condition of a possiblejudgement under the condition of a given judgement. The given judgementis the general rule (major). The subsumption of the condition ofanother possible judgement under the condition of the rule is theminor. The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rulein the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio). The rulepredicates something generally under a certain condition. The conditionof the rule is satisfied in some particular case. It follows that whatwas valid in general under that condition must also be considered asvalid in the particular case which satisfies this condition. It is veryplain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of theunderstanding which constitute a series of conditions. When I arrive atthe proposition, “All bodies are changeable,” by beginning with themore remote cognition (in which the conception of body does not appear,but which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception), “Allcompound is changeable,” by proceeding from this to a less remotecognition, which stands under the condition of the former, “Bodies arecompound,” and hence to a third, which at length connects for me theremote cognition (changeable) with the one before me, “Consequently,bodies are changeable”—I have arrived at a cognition (conclusion)through a series of conditions (premisses). Now every series, whoseexponent (of the categorical or hypothetical judgement) is given, canbe continued; consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us tothe ratiocinatio polysyllogistica, which is a series of syllogisms,that can be continued either on the side of the conditions (perprosyllogismos) or of the conditioned (per episyllogismos) to anindefinite extent.But we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms,that is, of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditionsof a given cognition, in other words, the ascending series ofsyllogisms must have a very different relation to the faculty of reasonfrom that of the descending series, that is, the progressive procedureof reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms.For, as in the former case the cognition (conclusio) is given only asconditioned, reason can attain to this cognition only under thepresupposition that all the members of the series on the side of theconditions are given (totality in the series of premisses), becauseonly under this supposition is the judgement we may be consideringpossible à priori; while on the side of the conditioned or theinferences, only an incomplete and becoming, and not a presupposed orgiven series, consequently only a potential progression, is cogitated.Hence, when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned, reason iscompelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line ascompleted and given in their totality. But if the very same conditionis considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions,which together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in adescending line, reason may preserve a perfect indifference, as to howfar this progression may extend _a parte posteriori_, and whether thetotality of this series is possible, because it stands in no need ofsuch a series for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it,inasmuch as this conclusion is sufficiently guaranteed and determinedon grounds a parte priori. It may be the case, that upon the side ofthe conditions the series of premisses has a first or highestcondition, or it may not possess this, and so be a parte prioriunlimited; but it must, nevertheless, contain totality of conditions,even admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehendingit; and the whole series must be unconditionally true, if theconditioned, which is considered as an inference resulting from it, isto be held as true. This is a requirement of reason, which announcesits cognition as determined à priori and as necessary, either initself—and in this case it needs no grounds to rest upon—or, if it isdeduced, as a member of a series of grounds, which is itselfunconditionally true.Section III. System of Transcendental IdeasWe are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic, which makescomplete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only atunveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms. Oursubject is transcendental dialectic, which must contain, completely àpriori, the origin of certain cognitions drawn from pure reason, andthe origin of certain deduced conceptions, the object of which cannotbe given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of thefaculty of understanding. We have observed, from the natural relationwhich the transcendental use of our cognition, in syllogisms as well asin judgements, must have to the logical, that there are three kinds ofdialectical arguments, corresponding to the three modes of conclusion,by which reason attains to cognitions on principles; and that in all itis the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis,beyond which the understanding never proceeds, to the unconditionedwhich the understanding never can reach.Now the most general relations which can exist in our representationsare: 1st, the relation to the subject; 2nd, the relation to objects,either as phenomena, or as objects of thought in general. If we connectthis subdivision with the main division, all the relations of ourrepresentations, of which we can form either a conception or an idea,are threefold: 1. The relation to the subject; 2. The relation to themanifold of the object as a phenomenon; 3. The relation to all thingsin general.Now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the syntheticalunity of representations; conceptions of pure reason (transcendentalideas), on the other hand, with the unconditional synthetical unity ofall conditions. It follows that all transcendental ideas arrangethemselves in three classes, the first of which contains the absolute(unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject, the second the absoluteunity of the series of the conditions of a phenomenon, the third theabsolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general.The thinking subject is the object-matter of Psychology; the sum totalof all phenomena (the world) is the object-matter of Cosmology; and thething which contains the highest condition of the possibility of allthat is cogitable (the being of all beings) is the object-matter of allTheology. Thus pure reason presents us with the idea of atranscendental doctrine of the soul (psychologia rationalis), of atranscendental science of the world (cosmologia rationalis), andfinally of a transcendental doctrine of God (theologiatranscendentalis). Understanding cannot originate even the outline ofany of these sciences, even when connected with the highest logical useof reason, that is, all cogitable syllogisms—for the purpose ofproceeding from one object (phenomenon) to all others, even to theutmost limits of the empirical synthesis. They are, on the contrary,pure and genuine products, or problems, of pure reason.What modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideasare will be fully exposed in the following chapter. They follow theguiding thread of the categories. For pure reason never relatesimmediately to objects, but to the conceptions of these contained inthe understanding. In like manner, it will be made manifest in thedetailed explanation of these ideas—how reason, merely through thesynthetical use of the same function which it employs in a categoricalsyllogism, necessarily attains to the conception of the absolute unityof the thinking subject—how the logical procedure in hypothetical ideasnecessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in aseries of given conditions, and finally—how the mere form of thedisjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of allbeings: a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degreeparadoxical.An objective deduction, such as we were able to present in the case ofthe categories, is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas.For they have, in truth, no relation to any object, in experience, forthe very reason that they are only ideas. But a subjective deduction ofthem from the nature of our reason is possible, and has been given inthe present chapter.It is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolutetotality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions, and that itdoes not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the Part ofthe conditioned. For of the former alone does she stand in need, inorder to preposit the whole series of conditions, and thus present themto the understanding à priori. But if we once have a completely (andunconditionally) given condition, there is no further necessity, inproceeding with the series, for a conception of reason; for theunderstanding takes of itself every step downward, from the conditionto the conditioned. Thus the transcendental ideas are available onlyfor ascending in the series of conditions, till we reach theunconditioned, that is, principles. As regards descending to theconditioned, on the other hand, we find that there is a widelyextensive logical use which reason makes of the laws of theunderstanding, but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible; andthat when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis,for example, of the whole series of all future changes in the world,this idea is a mere ens rationis, an arbitrary fiction of thought, andnot a necessary presupposition of reason. For the possibility of theconditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions, but not of itsconsequences. Consequently, this conception is not a transcendentalidea—and it is with these alone that we are at present occupied.Finally, it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideasa certain connection and unity, and that pure reason, by means of them,collects all its cognitions into one system. From the cognition of selfto the cognition of the world, and through these to the supreme being,the progression is so natural, that it seems to resemble the logicalmarch of reason from the premisses to the conclusion.[42] Now whetherthere lies unobserved at the foundation of these ideas an analogy ofthe same kind as exists between the logical and transcendentalprocedure of reason, is another of those questions, the answer to whichwe must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage in ourinquiries. In this cursory and preliminary view, we have, meanwhile,reached our aim. For we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached tothe transcendental conceptions of reason, from their being commonlymixed up with other conceptions in the systems of philosophers, and notproperly distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding; wehave exposed their origin and, thereby, at the same time theirdeterminate number, and presented them in a systematic connection, andhave thus marked out and enclosed a definite sphere for pure reason. [42] The science of Metaphysics has for the proper object of its inquiries only three grand ideas: GOD, FREEDOM, and IMMORTALITY, and it aims at showing, that the second conception, conjoined with the first, must lead to the third, as a necessary conclusion. All the other subjects with which it occupies itself, are merely means for the attainment and realization of these ideas. It does not require these ideas for the construction of a science of nature, but, on the contrary, for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature. A complete insight into and comprehension of them would render Theology, Ethics, and, through the conjunction of both, Religion, solely dependent on the speculative faculty of reason. In a systematic representation of these ideas the above-mentioned arrangement—the synthetical one—would be the most suitable; but in the investigation which must necessarily precede it, the analytical, which reverses this arrangement, would be better adapted to our purpose, as in it we should proceed from that which experience immediately presents to us—psychology, to cosmology, and thence to theology.TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC—BOOK II—OF THE DIALECTICAL PROCEDURE OF PUREREASONIt may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea issomething of which we have no conception, although the idea may be anecessary product of reason according to its original laws. For, infact, a conception of an object that is adequate to the idea given byreason, is impossible. For such an object must be capable of beingpresented and intuited in a Possible experience. But we should expressour meaning better, and with less risk of being misunderstood, if wesaid that we can have no knowledge of an object, which perfectlycorresponds to an idea, although we may possess a problematicalconception thereof.Now the transcendental (subjective) reality at least of the pureconceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideasby a necessary procedure of reason. There must therefore be syllogismswhich contain no empirical premisses, and by means of which we concludefrom something that we do know, to something of which we do not evenpossess a conception, to which we, nevertheless, by an unavoidableillusion, ascribe objective reality. Such arguments are, as regardstheir result, rather to be termed sophisms than syllogisms, althoughindeed, as regards their origin, they are very well entitled to thelatter name, inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental productsof reason, but are necessitated by its very nature. They are sophisms,not of men, but of pure reason herself, from which the Wisest cannotfree himself. After long labour he may be able to guard against theerror, but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion whichcontinually mocks and misleads him.Of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds, corresponding tothe number of the ideas which their conclusions present. In theargument or syllogism of the first class, I conclude, from thetranscendental conception of the subject contains no manifold, theabsolute unity of the subject itself, of which I cannot in this mannerattain to a conception. This dialectical argument I shall call thetranscendental paralogism. The second class of sophistical arguments isoccupied with the transcendental conception of the absolute totality ofthe series of conditions for a given phenomenon, and I conclude, fromthe fact that I have always a self-contradictory conception of theunconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon one side, the truthof the opposite unity, of which I have nevertheless no conception. Thecondition of reason in these dialectical arguments, I shall term theantinomy of pure reason. Finally, according to the third kind ofsophistical argument, I conclude, from the totality of the conditionsof thinking objects in general, in so far as they can be given, theabsolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the possibility ofthings in general; that is, from things which I do not know in theirmere transcendental conception, I conclude a being of all beings whichI know still less by means of a transcendental conception, and of whoseunconditioned necessity I can form no conception whatever. Thisdialectical argument I shall call the ideal of pure reason.Chapter I. Of the Paralogisms of Pure ReasonThe logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument inrespect of its form, be the content what it may. But a transcendentalparalogism has a transcendental foundation, and concludes falsely,while the form is correct and unexceptionable. In this manner theparalogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason, and is theparent of an unavoidable, though not insoluble, mental illusion.We now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general listof transcendental conceptions, and yet must be reckoned with them, butat the same time without in the least altering, or indicating adeficiency in that table. This is the conception, or, if the term ispreferred, the judgement, “I think.” But it is readily perceived thatthis thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general,and consequently of transcendental conceptions also, and that it istherefore regarded as a transcendental conception, although it can haveno peculiar claim to be so ranked, inasmuch as its only use is toindicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness. At the sametime, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions ofthe senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds ofobjects. “I,” as thinking, am an object of the internal sense, and amcalled soul. That which is an object of the external senses is calledbody. Thus the expression, “I,” as a thinking being, designates theobject-matter of psychology, which may be called “the rational doctrineof the soul,” inasmuch as in this science I desire to know nothing ofthe soul but what, independently of all experience (which determines mein concreto), may be concluded from this conception “I,” in so far asit appears in all thought.Now, the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of thiskind. For if the smallest empirical element of thought, if anyparticular perception of my internal state, were to be introduced amongthe grounds of cognition of this science, it would not be a rational,but an empirical doctrine of the soul. We have thus before us apretended science, raised upon the single proposition, “I think,” whosefoundation or want of foundation we may very properly, and agreeablywith the nature of a transcendental philosophy, here examine. It oughtnot to be objected that in this proposition, which expresses theperception of one’s self, an internal experience is asserted, and thatconsequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is founded uponit, is not pure, but partly founded upon an empirical principle. Forthis internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception, “Ithink,” which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions possible,in which we say, “I think substance, cause, etc.” For internalexperience in general and its possibility, or perception in general,and its relation to other perceptions, unless some particulardistinction or determination thereof is empirically given, cannot beregarded as empirical cognition, but as cognition of the empirical, andbelongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience,which is certainly transcendental. The smallest object of experience(for example, only pleasure or pain), that should be included in thegeneral representation of self-consciousness, would immediately changethe rational into an empirical psychology.“I think” is therefore the only text of rational psychology, from whichit must develop its whole system. It is manifest that this thought,when applied to an object (myself), can contain nothing buttranscendental predicates thereof; because the least empiricalpredicate would destroy the purity of the science and its independenceof all experience.But we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categories—only,as in the present case a thing, “I,” as thinking being, is at firstgiven, we shall—not indeed change the order of the categories as itstands in the table—but begin at the category of substance, by which atthe a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through theseries. The topic of the rational doctrine of the soul, from whicheverything else it may contain must be deduced, is accordingly asfollows:            1                          2  The Soul is SUBSTANCE       As regards its quality                                it is SIMPLE                      3          As regards the different          times in which it exists,          it is numerically identical,          that is UNITY, not Plurality.                       4  It is in relation to possible objects in space[43] [43] The reader, who may not so easily perceive the psychological sense of these expressions, taken here in their transcendental abstraction, and cannot guess why the latter attribute of the soul belongs to the category of existence, will find the expressions sufficiently explained and justified in the sequel. I have, moreover, to apologize for the Latin terms which have been employed, instead of their German synonyms, contrary to the rules of correct writing. But I judged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity.From these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology,by combination alone, without the aid of any other principle. Thissubstance, merely as an object of the internal sense, gives theconception of Immateriality; as simple substance, that ofIncorruptibility; its identity, as intellectual substance, gives theconception of Personality; all these three together, Spirituality. Itsrelation to objects in space gives us the conception of connection(commercium) with bodies. Thus it represents thinking substance as theprinciple of life in matter, that is, as a soul (anima), and as theground of Animality; and this, limited and determined by the conceptionof spirituality, gives us that of Immortality.Now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendentalpsychology, which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason,touching the nature of our thinking being. We can, however, lay at thefoundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itselfperfectly contentless representation “i” which cannot even be called aconception, but merely a consciousness which accompanies allconceptions. By this “I,” or “He,” or “It,” who or which thinks,nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought =x, which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are itspredicates, and of which, apart from these, we cannot form the leastconception. Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must alwaysemploy it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it. And thisinconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of, becauseconsciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishinga particular object, as a form of representation in general, in so faras it may be termed cognition; for in and by cognition alone do I thinkanything.It must, however, appear extraordinary at first sight that thecondition under which I think, and which is consequently a property ofmy subject, should be held to be likewise valid for every existencewhich thinks, and that we can presume to base upon a seeminglyempirical proposition a judgement which is apodeictic and universal, towit, that everything which thinks is constituted as the voice of myconsciousness declares it to be, that is, as a self-conscious being.The cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarilyattribute to things à priori all the properties which constituteconditions under which alone we can cogitate them. Now I cannot obtainthe least representation of a thinking being by means of externalexperience, but solely through self-consciousness. Such objects areconsequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousnessof mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinkingbeings. The proposition, “I think,” is, in the present case, understoodin a problematical sense, not in so far as it contains a perception ofan existence (like the Cartesian “Cogito, ergo sum”), but in regard toits mere possibility—for the purpose of discovering what properties maybe inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subjectof it.If at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beingsthere lay more than the mere Cogito—if we could likewise call in aidobservations on the play of our thoughts, and the thence derivednatural laws of the thinking self, there would arise an empiricalpsychology which would be a kind of physiology of the internal senseand might possibly be capable of explaining the phenomena of thatsense. But it could never be available for discovering those propertieswhich do not belong to possible experience (such as the quality ofsimplicity), nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on the natureof thinking beings: it would therefore not be a rational psychology.Now, as the proposition “I think” (in the problematical sense) containsthe form of every judgement in general and is the constantaccompaniment of all the categories, it is manifest that conclusionsare drawn from it only by a transcendental employment of theunderstanding. This use of the understanding excludes all empiricalelements; and we cannot, as has been shown above, have any favourableconception beforehand of its procedure. We shall therefore follow witha critical eye this proposition through all the predicaments of purepsychology; but we shall, for brevity’s sake, allow this examination toproceed in an uninterrupted connection.Before entering on this task, however, the following general remark mayhelp to quicken our attention to this mode of argument. It is notmerely through my thinking that I cognize an object, but only throughmy determining a given intuition in relation to the unity ofconsciousness in which all thinking consists. It follows that I cognizemyself, not through my being conscious of myself as thinking, but onlywhen I am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined inrelation to the function of thought. All the modi of self-consciousnessin thought are hence not conceptions of objects (conceptions of theunderstanding—categories); they are mere logical functions, which donot present to thought an object to be cognized, and cannot thereforepresent my Self as an object. Not the consciousness of the determining,but only that of the determinable self, that is, of my internalintuition (in so far as the manifold contained in it can be connectedconformably with the general condition of the unity of apperception inthought), is the object.1. In all judgements I am the determining subject of that relationwhich constitutes a judgement. But that the I which thinks, must beconsidered as in thought always a subject, and as a thing which cannotbe a predicate to thought, is an apodeictic and identical proposition.But this proposition does not signify that I, as an object, am, formyself, a self-subsistent being or substance. This latter statement—anambitious one—requires to be supported by data which are not to bediscovered in thought; and are perhaps (in so far as I consider thethinking self merely as such) not to be discovered in the thinking selfat all.2. That the I or Ego of apperception, and consequently in all thought,is singular or simple, and cannot be resolved into a plurality ofsubjects, and therefore indicates a logically simple subject—this isself-evident from the very conception of an Ego, and is consequently ananalytical proposition. But this is not tantamount to declaring thatthe thinking Ego is a simple substance—for this would be a syntheticalproposition. The conception of substance always relates to intuitions,which with me cannot be other than sensuous, and which consequently liecompletely out of the sphere of the understanding and its thought: butto this sphere belongs the affirmation that the Ego is simple inthought. It would indeed be surprising, if the conception of“substance,” which in other cases requires so much labour todistinguish from the other elements presented by intuition—so muchtrouble, too, to discover whether it can be simple (as in the case ofthe parts of matter)—should be presented immediately to me, as if byrevelation, in the poorest mental representation of all.3. The proposition of the identity of my Self amidst all the manifoldrepresentations of which I am conscious, is likewise a propositionlying in the conceptions themselves, and is consequently analytical.But this identity of the subject, of which I am conscious in all itsrepresentations, does not relate to or concern the intuition of thesubject, by which it is given as an object. This proposition cannottherefore enounce the identity of the person, by which is understoodthe consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinkingbeing in all change and variation of circumstances. To prove this, weshould require not a mere analysis of the proposition, but syntheticaljudgements based upon a given intuition.4. I distinguish my own existence, as that of a thinking being, fromthat of other things external to me—among which my body also isreckoned. This is also an analytical proposition, for other things areexactly those which I think as different or distinguished from myself.But whether this consciousness of myself is possible without thingsexternal to me; and whether therefore I can exist merely as a thinkingbeing (without being man)—cannot be known or inferred from thisproposition.Thus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself asobject, by the analysis of the consciousness of my Self in thought. Thelogical exposition of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysicaldetermination of the object.Our Critique would be an investigation utterly superfluous, if thereexisted a possibility of proving à priori, that all thinking beings arein themselves simple substances, as such, therefore, possess theinseparable attribute of personality, and are conscious of theirexistence apart from and unconnected with matter. For we should thushave taken a step beyond the world of sense, and have penetrated intothe sphere of noumena; and in this case the right could not be deniedus of extending our knowledge in this sphere, of establishingourselves, and, under a favouring star, appropriating to ourselvespossessions in it. For the proposition: “Every thinking being, as such,is simple substance,” is an à priori synthetical proposition; becausein the first place it goes beyond the conception which is the subjectof it, and adds to the mere notion of a thinking being the mode of itsexistence, and in the second place annexes a predicate (that ofsimplicity) to the latter conception—a predicate which it could nothave discovered in the sphere of experience. It would follow that àpriori synthetical propositions are possible and legitimate, not only,as we have maintained, in relation to objects of possible experience,and as principles of the possibility of this experience itself, but areapplicable to things in themselves—an inference which makes an end ofthe whole of this Critique, and obliges us to fall back on the old modeof metaphysical procedure. But indeed the danger is not so great, if welook a little closer into the question.There lurks in the procedure of rational Psychology a paralogism, whichis represented in the following syllogism:That which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject, does notexist otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.A thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be cogitatedotherwise than as subject.Therefore it exists also as such, that is, as substance.In the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and inevery relation, consequently as it may be given in intuition. But inthe minor we speak of the same being only in so far as it regardsitself as subject, relatively to thought and the unity ofconsciousness, but not in relation to intuition, by which it ispresented as an object to thought. Thus the conclusion is here arrivedat by a Sophisma figurae dictionis.[44] [44] Thought is taken in the two premisses in two totally different senses. In the major it is considered as relating and applying to objects in general, consequently to objects of intuition also. In the minor, we understand it as relating merely to self-consciousness. In this sense, we do not cogitate an object, but merely the relation to the self-consciousness of the subject, as the form of thought. In the former premiss we speak of things which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subjects. In the second, we do not speak of things, but of thought (all objects being abstracted), in which the Ego is always the subject of consciousness. Hence the conclusion cannot be, “I cannot exist otherwise than as subject”; but only “I can, in cogitating my existence, employ my Ego only as the subject of the judgement.” But this is an identical proposition, and throws no light on the mode of my existence.That this famous argument is a mere paralogism, will be plain to anyone who will consider the general remark which precedes our expositionof the principles of the pure understanding, and the section onnoumena. For it was there proved that the conception of a thing, whichcan exist per se—only as a subject and never as a predicate, possessesno objective reality; that is to say, we can never know whether thereexists any object to correspond to the conception; consequently, theconception is nothing more than a conception, and from it we derive noproper knowledge. If this conception is to indicate by the termsubstance, an object that can be given, if it is to become a cognition,we must have at the foundation of the cognition a permanent intuition,as the indispensable condition of its objective reality. For throughintuition alone can an object be given. But in internal intuition thereis nothing permanent, for the Ego is but the consciousness of mythought. If then, we appeal merely to thought, we cannot discover thenecessary condition of the application of the conception ofsubstance—that is, of a subject existing per se—to the subject as athinking being. And thus the conception of the simple nature ofsubstance, which is connected with the objective reality of thisconception, is shown to be also invalid, and to be, in fact, nothingmore than the logical qualitative unity of self-consciousness inthought; whilst we remain perfectly ignorant whether the subject iscomposite or not.Refutation of the Argument of Mendelssohn for the Substantiality orPermanence of the Soul.This acute philosopher easily perceived the insufficiency of the commonargument which attempts to prove that the soul—it being granted that itis a simple being—cannot perish by dissolution or decomposition; he sawit is not impossible for it to cease to be by extinction, ordisappearance. He endeavoured to prove in his Phaedo, that the soulcannot be annihilated, by showing that a simple being cannot cease toexist. Inasmuch as, he said, a simple existence cannot diminish, norgradually lose portions of its being, and thus be by degrees reduced tonothing (for it possesses no parts, and therefore no multiplicity),between the moment in which it is, and the moment in which it is not,no time can be discovered—which is impossible. But this philosopher didnot consider that, granting the soul to possess this simple nature,which contains no parts external to each other and consequently noextensive quantity, we cannot refuse to it any less than to any otherbeing, intensive quantity, that is, a degree of reality in regard toall its faculties, nay, to all that constitutes its existence. But thisdegree of reality can become less and less through an infinite seriesof smaller degrees. It follows, therefore, that this supposedsubstance—this thing, the permanence of which is not assured in anyother way, may, if not by decomposition, by gradual loss (remissio) ofits powers (consequently by elanguescence, if I may employ thisexpression), be changed into nothing. For consciousness itself hasalways a degree, which may be lessened.[45] Consequently the faculty ofbeing conscious may be diminished; and so with all other faculties. Thepermanence of the soul, therefore, as an object of the internal sense,remains undemonstrated, nay, even indemonstrable. Its permanence inlife is evident, per se, inasmuch as the thinking being (as man) is toitself, at the same time, an object of the external senses. But thisdoes not authorize the rational psychologist to affirm, from mereconceptions, its permanence beyond life.[46] [45] Clearness is not, as logicians maintain, the consciousness of a representation. For a certain degree of consciousness, which may not, however, be sufficient for recollection, is to be met with in many dim representations. For without any consciousness at all, we should not be able to recognize any difference in the obscure representations we connect; as we really can do with many conceptions, such as those of right and justice, and those of the musician, who strikes at once several notes in improvising a piece of music. But a representation is clear, in which our consciousness is sufficient for the consciousness of the difference of this representation from others. If we are only conscious that there is a difference, but are not conscious of the difference—that is, what the difference is—the representation must be termed obscure. There is, consequently, an infinite series of degrees of consciousness down to its entire disappearance. [46] There are some who think they have done enough to establish a new possibility in the mode of the existence of souls, when they have shown that there is no contradiction in their hypotheses on this subject. Such are those who affirm the possibility of thought—of which they have no other knowledge than what they derive from its use in connecting empirical intuitions presented in this our human life—after this life has ceased. But it is very easy to embarrass them by the introduction of counter-possibilities, which rest upon quite as good a foundation. Such, for example, is the possibility of the division of a simple substance into several substances; and conversely, of the coalition of several into one simple substance. For, although divisibility presupposes composition, it does not necessarily require a composition of substances, but only of the degrees (of the several faculties) of one and the same substance. Now we can cogitate all the powers and faculties of the soul—even that of consciousness—as diminished by one half, the substance still remaining. In the same way we can represent to ourselves without contradiction, this obliterated half as preserved, not in the soul, but without it; and we can believe that, as in this case every thing that is real in the soul, and has a degree—consequently its entire existence—has been halved, a particular substance would arise out of the soul. For the multiplicity, which has been divided, formerly existed, but not as a multiplicity of substances, but of every reality as the quantum of existence in it; and the unity of substance was merely a mode of existence, which by this division alone has been transformed into a plurality of subsistence. In the same manner several simple substances might coalesce into one, without anything being lost except the plurality of subsistence, inasmuch as the one substance would contain the degree of reality of all the former substances. Perhaps, indeed, the simple substances, which appear under the form of matter, might (not indeed by a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other, but by an unknown influence, of which the former would be but the phenomenal appearance), by means of such a dynamical division of the parent-souls, as intensive quantities, produce other souls, while the former repaired the loss thus sustained with new matter of the same sort. I am far from allowing any value to such chimeras; and the principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an empirical use of the categories—that of substance, for example—is possible. But if the rationalist is bold enough to construct, on the mere authority of the faculty of thought—without any intuition, whereby an object is given—a self-subsistent being, merely because the unity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a composite being, instead of declaring, as he ought to do, that he is unable to explain the possibility of a thinking nature; what ought to hinder the materialist, with as complete an independence of experience, to employ the principle of the rationalist in a directly opposite manner—still preserving the formal unity required by his opponent?If, now, we take the above propositions—as they must be accepted asvalid for all thinking beings in the system of rational psychology—insynthetical connection, and proceed, from the category of relation,with the proposition: “All thinking beings are, as such, substances,”backwards through the series, till the circle is completed; we come atlast to their existence, of which, in this system of rationalpsychology, substances are held to be conscious, independently ofexternal things; nay, it is asserted that, in relation to thepermanence which is a necessary characteristic of substance, they canof themselves determine external things. It follows that idealism—atleast problematical idealism, is perfectly unavoidable in thisrationalistic system. And, if the existence of outward things is notheld to be requisite to the determination of the existence of asubstance in time, the existence of these outward things at all, is agratuitous assumption which remains without the possibility of a proof.But if we proceed analytically—the “I think” as a propositioncontaining in itself an existence as given, consequently modality beingthe principle—and dissect this proposition, in order to ascertain itscontent, and discover whether and how this Ego determines its existencein time and space without the aid of anything external; thepropositions of rationalistic psychology would not begin with theconception of a thinking being, but with a reality, and the propertiesof a thinking being in general would be deduced from the mode in whichthis reality is cogitated, after everything empirical had beenabstracted; as is shown in the following table:                        1                      I think,            2                             3        as Subject,              as simple Subject,                        4               as identical Subject,           in every state of my thought.Now, inasmuch as it is not determined in this second proposition,whether I can exist and be cogitated only as subject, and not also as apredicate of another being, the conception of a subject is here takenin a merely logical sense; and it remains undetermined, whethersubstance is to be cogitated under the conception or not. But in thethird proposition, the absolute unity of apperception—the simple Ego inthe representation to which all connection and separation, whichconstitute thought, relate, is of itself important; even although itpresents us with no information about the constitution or subsistenceof the subject. Apperception is something real, and the simplicity ofits nature is given in the very fact of its possibility. Now in spacethere is nothing real that is at the same time simple; for points,which are the only simple things in space, are merely limits, but notconstituent parts of space. From this follows the impossibility of adefinition on the basis of materialism of the constitution of my Ego asa merely thinking subject. But, because my existence is considered inthe first proposition as given, for it does not mean, “Every thinkingbeing exists” (for this would be predicating of them absolutenecessity), but only, “I exist thinking”; the proposition is quiteempirical, and contains the determinability of my existence merely inrelation to my representations in time. But as I require for thispurpose something that is permanent, such as is not given in internalintuition; the mode of my existence, whether as substance or asaccident, cannot be determined by means of this simpleself-consciousness. Thus, if materialism is inadequate to explain themode in which I exist, spiritualism is likewise as insufficient; andthe conclusion is that we are utterly unable to attain to any knowledgeof the constitution of the soul, in so far as relates to thepossibility of its existence apart from external objects.And, indeed, how should it be possible, merely by the aid of the unityof consciousness—which we cognize only for the reason that it isindispensable to the possibility of experience—to pass the bounds ofexperience (our existence in this life); and to extend our cognition tothe nature of all thinking beings by means of the empirical—but inrelation to every sort of intuition, perfectlyundetermined—proposition, “I think”?There does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrinefurnishing any addition to our knowledge of ourselves. It is nothingmore than a discipline, which sets impassable limits to speculativereason in this region of thought, to prevent it, on the one hand, fromthrowing itself into the arms of a soulless materialism, and, on theother, from losing itself in the mazes of a baseless spiritualism. Itteaches us to consider this refusal of our reason to give anysatisfactory answer to questions which reach beyond the limits of thisour human life, as a hint to abandon fruitless speculation; and todirect, to a practical use, our knowledge of ourselves—which, althoughapplicable only to objects of experience, receives its principles froma higher source, and regulates its procedure as if our destiny reachedfar beyond the boundaries of experience and life.From all this it is evident that rational psychology has its origin ina mere misunderstanding. The unity of consciousness, which lies at thebasis of the categories, is considered to be an intuition of thesubject as an object; and the category of substance is applied to theintuition. But this unity is nothing more than the unity in thought, bywhich no object is given; to which therefore the category ofsubstance—which always presupposes a given intuition—cannot be applied.Consequently, the subject cannot be cognized. The subject of thecategories cannot, therefore, for the very reason that it cogitatesthese, frame any conception of itself as an object of the categories;for, to cogitate these, it must lay at the foundation its own pureself-consciousness—the very thing that it wishes to explain anddescribe. In like manner, the subject, in which the representation oftime has its basis, cannot determine, for this very reason, its ownexistence in time. Now, if the latter is impossible, the former, as anattempt to determine itself by means of the categories as a thinkingbeing in general, is no less so.[47] [47] The “I think” is, as has been already stated, an empirical proposition, and contains the proposition, “I exist.” But I cannot say, “Everything, which thinks, exists”; for in this case the property of thought would constitute all beings possessing it, necessary beings. Hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from the proposition, “I think,” as Descartes maintained—because in this case the major premiss, “Everything, which thinks, exists,” must precede—but the two propositions are identical. The proposition, “I think,” expresses an undetermined empirical intuition, that perception (proving consequently that sensation, which must belong to sensibility, lies at the foundation of this proposition); but it precedes experience, whose province it is to determine an object of perception by means of the categories in relation to time; and existence in this proposition is not a category, as it does not apply to an undetermined given object, but only to one of which we have a conception, and about which we wish to know whether it does or does not exist, out of, and apart from this conception. An undetermined perception signifies here merely something real that has been given, only, however, to thought in general—but not as a phenomenon, nor as a thing in itself (noumenon), but only as something that really exists, and is designated as such in the proposition, “I think.” For it must be remarked that, when I call the proposition, “I think,” an empirical proposition, I do not thereby mean that the Ego in the proposition is an empirical representation; on the contrary, it is purely intellectual, because it belongs to thought in general. But without some empirical representation, which presents to the mind material for thought, the mental act, “I think,” would not take place; and the empirical is only the condition of the application or employment of the pure intellectual faculty.Thus, then, appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognitionwhich is to extend its rule beyond the limits of experience—a cognitionwhich is one of the highest interests of humanity; and thus is provedthe futility of the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region ofthought. But, in this interest of thought, the severity of criticismhas rendered to reason a not unimportant service, by the demonstrationof the impossibility of making any dogmatical affirmation concerning anobject of experience beyond the boundaries of experience. She has thusfortified reason against all affirmations of the contrary. Now, thiscan be accomplished in only two ways. Either our proposition must beproved apodeictically; or, if this is unsuccessful, the sources of thisinability must be sought for, and, if these are discovered to exist inthe natural and necessary limitation of our reason, our opponents mustsubmit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancingclaims to dogmatic assertion.But the right, say rather the necessity to admit a future life, uponprinciples of the practical conjoined with the speculative use ofreason, has lost nothing by this renunciation; for the merelyspeculative proof has never had any influence upon the common reason ofmen. It stands upon the point of a hair, so that even the schools havebeen able to preserve it from falling only by incessantly discussing itand spinning it like a top; and even in their eyes it has never beenable to present any safe foundation for the erection of a theory. Theproofs which have been current among men, preserve their valueundiminished; nay, rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power,by the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason.For reason is thus confined within her own peculiar province—thearrangement of ends or aims, which is at the same time the arrangementof nature; and, as a practical faculty, without limiting itself to thelatter, it is justified in extending the former, and with it our ownexistence, beyond the boundaries of experience and life. If we turn ourattention to the analogy of the nature of living beings in this world,in the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept as aprinciple that no organ, no faculty, no appetite is useless, and thatnothing is superfluous, nothing disproportionate to its use, nothingunsuited to its end; but that, on the contrary, everything is perfectlyconformed to its destination in life—we shall find that man, who aloneis the final end and aim of this order, is still the only animal thatseems to be excepted from it. For his natural gifts—not merely asregards the talents and motives that may incite him to employ them, butespecially the moral law in him—stretch so far beyond all mere earthlyutility and advantage, that he feels himself bound to prize the mereconsciousness of probity, apart from all advantageous consequences—eventhe shadowy gift of posthumous fame—above everything; and he isconscious of an inward call to constitute himself, by his conduct inthis world—without regard to mere sublunary interests—the citizen of abetter. This mighty, irresistible proof—accompanied by anever-increasing knowledge of the conformability to a purpose ineverything we see around us, by the conviction of the boundlessimmensity of creation, by the consciousness of a certainillimitableness in the possible extension of our knowledge, and by adesire commensurate therewith—remains to humanity, even after thetheoretical cognition of ourselves has failed to establish thenecessity of an existence after death.Conclusion of the Solution of the Psychological Paralogism.The dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from ourconfounding an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with theconception—in every respect undetermined—of a thinking being ingeneral. I cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience, at thesame time making abstraction of all actual experience; and infertherefrom that I can be conscious of myself apart from experience andits empirical conditions. I consequently confound the possibleabstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposedconsciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self; andI believe that I cognize what is substantial in myself as atranscendental subject, when I have nothing more in thought than theunity of consciousness, which lies at the basis of all determination ofcognition.The task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does notproperly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking;because it proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart fromthis communion (after death), and is therefore transcendent in theproper sense of the word, although occupying itself with an object ofexperience—only in so far, however, as it ceases to be an object ofexperience. But a sufficient answer may be found to the question in oursystem. The difficulty which lies in the execution of this taskconsists, as is well known, in the presupposed heterogeneity of theobject of the internal sense (the soul) and the objects of the externalsenses; inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one istime, and of that of the other space also. But if we consider that bothkinds of objects do not differ internally, but only in so far as theone appears externally to the other—consequently, that what lies at thebasis of phenomena, as a thing in itself, may not be heterogeneous;this difficulty disappears. There then remains no other difficulty thanis to be found in the question—how a community of substances ispossible; a question which lies out of the region of psychology, andwhich the reader, after what in our analytic has been said of primitiveforces and faculties, will easily judge to be also beyond the region ofhuman cognition.GENERAL REMARKOn the Transition from Rational Psychology to Cosmology.The proposition, “I think,” or, “I exist thinking,” is an empiricalproposition. But such a proposition must be based on empiricalintuition, and the object cogitated as a phenomenon; and thus ourtheory appears to maintain that the soul, even in thought, is merely aphenomenon; and in this way our consciousness itself, in fact, abutsupon nothing.Thought, per se, is merely the purely spontaneous logical functionwhich operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition; and itdoes not represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenon—forthis reason alone, that it pays no attention to the question whetherthe mode of intuiting it is sensuous or intellectual. I therefore donot represent myself in thought either as I am, or as I appear tomyself; I merely cogitate myself as an object in general, of the modeof intuiting which I make abstraction. When I represent myself as thesubject of thought, or as the ground of thought, these modes ofrepresentation are not related to the categories of substance or ofcause; for these are functions of thought applicable only to oursensuous intuition. The application of these categories to the Egowould, however, be necessary, if I wished to make myself an object ofknowledge. But I wish to be conscious of myself only as thinking; inwhat mode my Self is given in intuition, I do not consider, and it maybe that I, who think, am a phenomenon—although not in so far as I am athinking being; but in the consciousness of myself in mere thought I ama being, though this consciousness does not present to me any propertyof this being as material for thought.But the proposition, “I think,” in so far as it declares, “I existthinking,” is not the mere representation of a logical function. Itdetermines the subject (which is in this case an object also) inrelation to existence; and it cannot be given without the aid of theinternal sense, whose intuition presents to us an object, not as athing in itself, but always as a phenomenon. In this proposition thereis therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity ofthought; there is also the receptivity of intuition, that is, mythought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself. Now, inthis intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of theemployment of its logical functions as categories of substance, cause,and so forth; not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as anobject in itself by means of the representation “I,” but also for thepurpose of determining the mode of its existence, that is, of cognizingitself as noumenon. But this is impossible, for the internal empiricalintuition is sensuous, and presents us with nothing but phenomenaldata, which do not assist the object of pure consciousness in itsattempt to cognize itself as a separate existence, but are useful onlyas contributions to experience.But, let it be granted that we could discover, not in experience, butin certain firmly-established à priori laws of the use of purereason—laws relating to our existence, authority to consider ourselvesas legislating à priori in relation to our own existence and asdetermining this existence; we should, on this supposition, findourselves possessed of a spontaneity, by which our actual existencewould be determinable, without the aid of the conditions of empiricalintuition. We should also become aware that in the consciousness of ourexistence there was an à priori content, which would serve to determineour own existence—an existence only sensuously determinable—relatively,however, to a certain internal faculty in relation to an intelligibleworld.But this would not give the least help to the attempts of rationalpsychology. For this wonderful faculty, which the consciousness of themoral law in me reveals, would present me with a principle of thedetermination of my own existence which is purely intellectual—but bywhat predicates? By none other than those which are given in sensuousintuition. Thus I should find myself in the same position in rationalpsychology which I formerly occupied, that is to say, I should findmyself still in need of sensuous intuitions, in order to givesignificance to my conceptions of substance and cause, by means ofwhich alone I can possess a knowledge of myself: but these intuitionscan never raise me above the sphere of experience. I should bejustified, however, in applying these conceptions, in regard to theirpractical use, which is always directed to objects of experience—inconformity with their analogical significance when employedtheoretically—to freedom and its subject. At the same time, I shouldunderstand by them merely the logical functions of subject andpredicate, of principle and consequence, in conformity with which allactions are so determined, that they are capable of being explainedalong with the laws of nature, conformably to the categories ofsubstance and cause, although they originate from a very differentprinciple. We have made these observations for the purpose of guardingagainst misunderstanding, to which the doctrine of our intuition ofself as a phenomenon is exposed. We shall have occasion to perceivetheir utility in the sequel.Chapter II. The Antinomy of Pure ReasonWe showed in the introduction to this part of our work, that alltranscendental illusion of pure reason arose from dialecticalarguments, the schema of which logic gives us in its three formalspecies of syllogisms—just as the categories find their logical schemain the four functions of all judgements. The first kind of thesesophistical arguments related to the unconditioned unity of thesubjective conditions of all representations in general (of the subjector soul), in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms, the majorof which, as the principle, enounces the relation of a predicate to asubject. The second kind of dialectical argument will therefore beconcerned, following the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms, with theunconditioned unity of the objective conditions in the phenomenon; and,in this way, the theme of the third kind to be treated of in thefollowing chapter will be the unconditioned unity of the objectiveconditions of the possibility of objects in general.But it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism producedin the mind only a one-third illusion, in regard to the idea of thesubject of our thought; and the conceptions of reason gave no ground tomaintain the contrary proposition. The advantage is completely on theside of Pneumatism; although this theory itself passes into naught, inthe crucible of pure reason.Very different is the case when we apply reason to the objectivesynthesis of phenomena. Here, certainly, reason establishes, with muchplausibility, its principle of unconditioned unity; but it very soonfalls into such contradictions that it is compelled, in relation tocosmology, to renounce its pretensions.For here a new phenomenon of human reason meets us—a perfectly naturalantithetic, which does not require to be sought for by subtlesophistry, but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls. It isthereby preserved, to be sure, from the slumber of a fanciedconviction—which a merely one-sided illusion produces; but it is at thesame time compelled, either, on the one hand, to abandon itself to adespairing scepticism, or, on the other, to assume a dogmaticalconfidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions, withoutgranting a fair hearing to the other side of the question. Either isthe death of a sound philosophy, although the former might perhapsdeserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason.Before entering this region of discord and confusion, which theconflict of the laws of pure reason (antinomy) produces, we shallpresent the reader with some considerations, in explanation andjustification of the method we intend to follow in our treatment ofthis subject. I term all transcendental ideas, in so far as they relateto the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena, cosmicalconceptions; partly on account of this unconditioned totality, on whichthe conception of the world-whole is based—a conception, which isitself an idea—partly because they relate solely to the synthesis ofphenomena—the empirical synthesis; while, on the other hand, theabsolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possiblethings gives rise to an ideal of pure reason, which is quite distinctfrom the cosmical conception, although it stands in relation with it.Hence, as the paralogisms of pure reason laid the foundation for adialectical psychology, the antinomy of pure reason will present uswith the transcendental principles of a pretended pure (rational)cosmology—not, however, to declare it valid and to appropriate it,but—as the very term of a conflict of reason sufficiently indicates, topresent it as an idea which cannot be reconciled with phenomena andexperience.Section I. System of Cosmological IdeasThat We may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideasaccording to a principle, we must remark, in the first place, that itis from the understanding alone that pure and transcendentalconceptions take their origin; that the reason does not properly givebirth to any conception, but only frees the conception of theunderstanding from the unavoidable limitation of a possible experience,and thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical, though it muststill be in connection with it. This happens from the fact that, for agiven conditioned, reason demands absolute totality on the side of theconditions (to which the understanding submits all phenomena), and thusmakes of the category a transcendental idea. This it does that it maybe able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis, bycontinuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found inexperience, but only in the idea). Reason requires this according tothe principle: If the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions,and consequently the absolutely unconditioned, is also given, wherebyalone the former was possible. First, then, the transcendental ideasare properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned; andthey may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter.But, secondly, all the categories are not available for this purpose,but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a series—ofconditions subordinated to, not co-ordinated with, each other. Absolutetotality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascendingseries of the conditions of a conditioned; not, consequently, when thequestion relates to the descending series of consequences, or to theaggregate of the co-ordinated conditions of these consequences. For, inrelation to a given conditioned, conditions are presupposed andconsidered to be given along with it. On the other hand, as theconsequences do not render possible their conditions, but ratherpresuppose them—in the consideration of the procession of consequences(or in the descent from the given condition to the conditioned), we maybe quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not; and theirtotality is not a necessary demand of reason.Thus we cogitate—and necessarily—a given time completely elapsed up toa given moment, although that time is not determinable by us. But asregards time future, which is not the condition of arriving at thepresent, in order to conceive it; it is quite indifferent whether weconsider future time as ceasing at some point, or as prolonging itselfto infinity. Take, for example, the series m, n, o, in which n is givenas conditioned in relation to m, but at the same time as the conditionof o, and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m(l, k, i, etc.), and also downwards from the condition n to theconditioned o (p, q, r, etc.)—I must presuppose the former series, tobe able to consider n as given, and n is according to reason (thetotality of conditions) possible only by means of that series. But itspossibility does not rest on the following series o, p, q, r, which forthis reason cannot be regarded as given, but only as capable of beinggiven (dabilis).I shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of theconditions—from that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the moreremote—regressive; that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned,from the immediate consequence to the more remote, I shall call theprogressive synthesis. The former proceeds in antecedentia, the latterin consequentia. The cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with thetotality of the regressive synthesis, and proceed in antecedentia, notin consequentia. When the latter takes place, it is an arbitrary andnot a necessary problem of pure reason; for we require, for thecomplete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon, not theconsequences which succeed, but the grounds or principles whichprecede.In order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with thetable of categories, we take first the two primitive quanta of all ourintuitions, time and space. Time is in itself a series (and the formalcondition of all series), and hence, in relation to a given present, wemust distinguish à priori in it the antecedentia as conditions (timepast) from the consequentia (time future). Consequently, thetranscendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of theconditions of a given conditioned, relates merely to all past time.According to the idea of reason, the whole past time, as the conditionof the given moment, is necessarily cogitated as given. But, as regardsspace, there exists in it no distinction between progressus andregressus; for it is an aggregate and not a series—its parts existingtogether at the same time. I can consider a given point of time inrelation to past time only as conditioned, because this given momentcomes into existence only through the past time rather through thepassing of the preceding time. But as the parts of space are notsubordinated, but co-ordinated to each other, one part cannot be thecondition of the possibility of the other; and space is not in itself,like time, a series. But the synthesis of the manifold parts ofspace—(the syntheses whereby we apprehend space)—is neverthelesssuccessive; it takes place, therefore, in time, and contains a series.And as in this series of aggregated spaces (for example, the feet in arood), beginning with a given portion of space, those which continue tobe annexed form the condition of the limits of the former—themeasurement of a space must also be regarded as a synthesis of theseries of the conditions of a given conditioned. It differs, however,in this respect from that of time, that the side of the conditioned isnot in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition; and,consequently, regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical.But, inasmuch as one part of space is not given, but only limited, byand through another, we must also consider every limited space asconditioned, in so far as it presupposes some other space as thecondition of its limitation, and so on. As regards limitation,therefore, our procedure in space is also a regressus, and thetranscendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in aseries of conditions applies to space also; and I am entitled to demandthe absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well asin time. Whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to beanswered in the sequel.Secondly, the real in space—that is, matter—is conditioned. Itsinternal conditions are its parts, and the parts of parts its remoteconditions; so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis, theabsolute totality of which is a demand of reason. But this cannot beobtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts, whereby thereal in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter, thatis to say, the simple. Consequently we find here also a series ofconditions and a progress to the unconditioned.Thirdly, as regards the categories of a real relation betweenphenomena, the category of substance and its accidents is not suitablefor the formation of a transcendental idea; that is to say, reason hasno ground, in regard to it, to proceed regressively with conditions.For accidents (in so far as they inhere in a substance) areco-ordinated with each other, and do not constitute a series. And, inrelation to substance, they are not properly subordinated to it, butare the mode of existence of the substance itself. The conception ofthe substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of thetranscendental reason. But, as this signifies nothing more than theconception of an object in general, which subsists in so far as wecogitate in it merely a transcendental subject without any predicates;and as the question here is of an unconditioned in the series ofphenomena—it is clear that the substantial can form no member thereof.The same holds good of substances in community, which are mereaggregates and do not form a series. For they are not subordinated toeach other as conditions of the possibility of each other; which,however, may be affirmed of spaces, the limits of which are neverdetermined in themselves, but always by some other space. It is,therefore, only in the category of causality that we can find a seriesof causes to a given effect, and in which we ascend from the latter, asthe conditioned, to the former as the conditions, and thus answer thequestion of reason.Fourthly, the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and thenecessary do not conduct us to any series—excepting only in so far asthe contingent in existence must always be regarded as conditioned, andas indicating, according to a law of the understanding, a condition,under which it is necessary to rise to a higher, till in the totalityof the series, reason arrives at unconditioned necessity.There are, accordingly, only four cosmological ideas, correspondingwith the four titles of the categories. For we can select only such asnecessarily furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold.                      1            The absolute Completeness                    of the                 COMPOSITION     of the given totality of all phenomena.                      2            The absolute Completeness                    of the                   DIVISION     of given totality in a phenomenon.                       3            The absolute Completeness                     of the                   ORIGINATION                  of a phenomenon.                       4            The absolute Completeness         of the DEPENDENCE of the EXISTENCE        of what is changeable in a phenomenon.We must here remark, in the first place, that the idea of absolutetotality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena, andtherefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things. Phenomenaare here, therefore, regarded as given, and reason requires theabsolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility, in so faras these conditions constitute a series—consequently an absolutely(that is, in every respect) complete synthesis, whereby a phenomenoncan be explained according to the laws of the understanding.Secondly, it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks inthis serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions. Itwishes, to speak in another way, to attain to completeness in theseries of premisses, so as to render it unnecessary to presupposeothers. This unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totalityof the series, when we endeavour to form a representation of it inthought. But this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea;for it is impossible, at least before hand, to know whether any suchsynthesis is possible in the case of phenomena. When we represent allexistence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding,without any conditions of sensuous intuition, we may say with justicethat for a given conditioned the whole series of conditionssubordinated to each other is also given; for the former is only giventhrough the latter. But we find in the case of phenomena a particularlimitation of the mode in which conditions are given, that is, throughthe successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, which must becomplete in the regress. Now whether this completeness is sensuouslypossible, is a problem. But the idea of it lies in the reason—be itpossible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empiricalconceptions. Therefore, as in the absolute totality of the regressivesynthesis of the manifold in a phenomenon (following the guidance ofthe categories, which represent it as a series of conditions to a givenconditioned) the unconditioned is necessarily contained—it being stillleft unascertained whether and how this totality exists; reason setsout from the idea of totality, although its proper and final aim is theunconditioned—of the whole series, or of a part thereof.This unconditioned may be cogitated—either as existing only in theentire series, all the members of which therefore would be withoutexception conditioned and only the totality absolutelyunconditioned—and in this case the regressus is called infinite; or theabsolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series, to which theother members are subordinated, but which Is not itself submitted toany other condition.[48] In the former case the series is a partepriori unlimited (without beginning), that is, infinite, andnevertheless completely given. But the regress in it is nevercompleted, and can only be called potentially infinite. In the secondcase there exists a first in the series. This first is called, inrelation to past time, the beginning of the world; in relation tospace, the limit of the world; in relation to the parts of a givenlimited whole, the simple; in relation to causes, absolute spontaneity(liberty); and in relation to the existence of changeable things,absolute physical necessity. [48] The absolute totality of the series of conditions to a given conditioned is always unconditioned; because beyond it there exist no other conditions, on which it might depend. But the absolute totality of such a series is only an idea, or rather a problematical conception, the possibility of which must be investigated—particularly in relation to the mode in which the unconditioned, as the transcendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry, may be contained therein.We possess two expressions, world and nature, which are generallyinterchanged. The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomenaand the totality of their synthesis—in its progress by means ofcomposition, as well as by division. And the world is termednature,[49] when it is regarded as a dynamical whole—when our attentionis not directed to the aggregation in space and time, for the purposeof cogitating it as a quantity, but to the unity in the existence ofphenomena. In this case the condition of that which happens is called acause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon istermed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sensea natural cause. The conditioned in existence is termed contingent, andthe unconditioned necessary. The unconditioned necessity of phenomenamay be called natural necessity. [49] Nature, understood adjective (formaliter), signifies the complex of the determinations of a thing, connected according to an internal principle of causality. On the other hand, we understand by nature, substantive (materialiter), the sum total of phenomena, in so far as they, by virtue of an internal principle of causality, are connected with each other throughout. In the former sense we speak of the nature of liquid matter, of fire, etc., and employ the word only adjective; while, if speaking of the objects of nature, we have in our minds the idea of a subsisting whole.The ideas which we are at present engaged in discussing I have calledcosmological ideas; partly because by the term world is understood theentire content of all phenomena, and our ideas are directed solely tothe unconditioned among phenomena; partly also, because world, in thetranscendental sense, signifies the absolute totality of the content ofexisting things, and we are directing our attention only to thecompleteness of the synthesis—although, properly, only in regression.In regard to the fact that these ideas are all transcendent, and,although they do not transcend phenomena as regards their mode, but areconcerned solely with the world of sense (and not with noumena),nevertheless carry their synthesis to a degree far above all possibleexperience—it still seems to me that we can, with perfect propriety,designate them cosmical conceptions. As regards the distinction betweenthe mathematically and the dynamically unconditioned which is the aimof the regression of the synthesis, I should call the two former, in amore limited signification, cosmical conceptions, the remaining twotranscendent physical conceptions. This distinction does not at presentseem to be of particular importance, but we shall afterwards find it tobe of some value.Section II. Antithetic of Pure ReasonThetic is the term applied to every collection of dogmaticalpropositions. By antithetic I do not understand dogmatical assertionsof the opposite, but the self-contradiction of seemingly dogmaticalcognitions (thesis cum antithesis), in none of which we can discoverany decided superiority. Antithetic is not, therefore, occupied withone-sided statements, but is engaged in considering the contradictorynature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes.Transcendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of purereason, its causes and result. If we employ our reason not merely inthe application of the principles of the understanding to objects ofexperience, but venture with it beyond these boundaries, there arisecertain sophistical propositions or theorems. These assertions have thefollowing peculiarities: They can find neither confirmation norconfutation in experience; and each is in itself not onlyself-consistent, but possesses conditions of its necessity in the verynature of reason—only that, unluckily, there exist just as valid andnecessary grounds for maintaining the contrary proposition.The questions which naturally arise in the consideration of thisdialectic of pure reason, are therefore: 1st. In what propositions ispure reason unavoidably subject to an antinomy? 2nd. What are thecauses of this antinomy? 3rd. Whether and in what way can reason freeitself from this self-contradiction?A dialectical proposition or theorem of pure reason must, according towhat has been said, be distinguishable from all sophisticalpropositions, by the fact that it is not an answer to an arbitraryquestion, which may be raised at the mere pleasure of any person, butto one which human reason must necessarily encounter in its progress.In the second place, a dialectical proposition, with its opposite, doesnot carry the appearance of a merely artificial illusion, whichdisappears as soon as it is investigated, but a natural and unavoidableillusion, which, even when we are no longer deceived by it, continuesto mock us and, although rendered harmless, can never be completelyremoved.This dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understandingin empirical conceptions, but to the unity of reason in pure ideas. Theconditions of this doctrine are—inasmuch as it must, as a synthesisaccording to rules, be conformable to the understanding, and at thesame time as the absolute unity of the synthesis, to the reason—that,if it is adequate to the unity of reason, it is too great for theunderstanding, if according with the understanding, it is too small forthe reason. Hence arises a mutual opposition, which cannot be avoided,do what we will.These sophistical assertions of dialectic open, as it were, abattle-field, where that side obtains the victory which has beenpermitted to make the attack, and he is compelled to yield who has beenunfortunately obliged to stand on the defensive. And hence, championsof ability, whether on the right or on the wrong side, are certain tocarry away the crown of victory, if they only take care to have theright to make the last attack, and are not obliged to sustain anotheronset from their opponent. We can easily believe that this arena hasbeen often trampled by the feet of combatants, that many victories havebeen obtained on both sides, but that the last victory, decisive of theaffair between the contending parties, was won by him who fought forthe right, only if his adversary was forbidden to continue the tourney.As impartial umpires, we must lay aside entirely the considerationwhether the combatants are fighting for the right or for the wrongside, for the true or for the false, and allow the combat to be firstdecided. Perhaps, after they have wearied more than injured each other,they will discover the nothingness of their cause of quarrel and partgood friends.This method of watching, or rather of originating, a conflict ofassertions, not for the purpose of finally deciding in favour of eitherside, but to discover whether the object of the struggle is not a mereillusion, which each strives in vain to reach, but which would be nogain even when reached—this procedure, I say, may be termed thesceptical method. It is thoroughly distinct from scepticism—theprinciple of a technical and scientific ignorance, which undermines thefoundations of all knowledge, in order, if possible, to destroy ourbelief and confidence therein. For the sceptical method aims atcertainty, by endeavouring to discover in a conflict of this kind,conducted honestly and intelligently on both sides, the point ofmisunderstanding; just as wise legislators derive, from theembarrassment of judges in lawsuits, information in regard to thedefective and ill-defined parts of their statutes. The antinomy whichreveals itself in the application of laws, is for our limited wisdomthe best criterion of legislation. For the attention of reason, whichin abstract speculation does not easily become conscious of its errors,is thus roused to the momenta in the determination of its principles.But this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendentalphilosophy, and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field ofinvestigation. In mathematics its use would be absurd; because in it nofalse assertions can long remain hidden, inasmuch as its demonstrationsmust always proceed under the guidance of pure intuition, and by meansof an always evident synthesis. In experimental philosophy, doubt anddelay may be very useful; but no misunderstanding is possible, whichcannot be easily removed; and in experience means of solving thedifficulty and putting an end to the dissension must at last be found,whether sooner or later. Moral philosophy can always exhibit itsprinciples, with their practical consequences, in concreto—at least inpossible experiences, and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities ofabstraction. But transcendental propositions, which lay claim toinsight beyond the region of possible experience, cannot, on the onehand, exhibit their abstract synthesis in any à priori intuition, nor,on the other, expose a lurking error by the help of experience.Transcendental reason, therefore, presents us with no other criterionthan that of an attempt to reconcile such assertions, and for thispurpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict between them. Andthis we now proceed to arrange.[50] [50] The antinomies stand in the order of the four transcendental ideas above detailed.FIRST CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited in regard tospace.PROOF.Granted that the world has no beginning in time; up to every givenmoment of time, an eternity must have elapsed, and therewith passedaway an infinite series of successive conditions or states of things inthe world. Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that itnever can be completed by means of a successive synthesis. It followsthat an infinite series already elapsed is impossible and that,consequently, a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of itsexistence. And this was the first thing to be proved.As regards the second, let us take the opposite for granted. In thiscase, the world must be an infinite given total of coexistent things.Now we cannot cogitate the dimensions of a quantity, which is not givenwithin certain limits of an intuition,[51] in any other way than bymeans of the synthesis of its parts, and the total of such a quantityonly by means of a completed synthesis, or the repeated addition ofunity to itself. Accordingly, to cogitate the world, which fills allspaces, as a whole, the successive synthesis of the parts of aninfinite world must be looked upon as completed, that is to say, aninfinite time must be regarded as having elapsed in the enumeration ofall co-existing things; which is impossible. For this reason aninfinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a givenwhole, consequently, not as a contemporaneously given whole. The worldis consequently, as regards extension in space, not infinite, butenclosed in limits. And this was the second thing to be proved. [51] We may consider an undetermined quantity as a whole, when it is enclosed within limits, although we cannot construct or ascertain its totality by measurement, that is, by the successive synthesis of its parts. For its limits of themselves determine its completeness as a whole.ANTITHESIS.The world has no beginning, and no limits in space, but is, in relationboth to time and space, infinite.PROOF.For let it be granted that it has a beginning. A beginning is anexistence which is preceded by a time in which the thing does notexist. On the above supposition, it follows that there must have been atime in which the world did not exist, that is, a void time. But in avoid time the origination of a thing is impossible; because no part ofany such time contains a distinctive condition of being, in preferenceto that of non-being (whether the supposed thing originate of itself,or by means of some other cause). Consequently, many series of thingsmay have a beginning in the world, but the world itself cannot have abeginning, and is, therefore, in relation to past time, infinite.As regards the second statement, let us first take the opposite forgranted—that the world is finite and limited in space; it follows thatit must exist in a void space, which is not limited. We shouldtherefore meet not only with a relation of things in space, but also arelation of things to space. Now, as the world is an absolute whole,out of and beyond which no object of intuition, and consequently nocorrelate to which can be discovered, this relation of the world to avoid space is merely a relation to no object. But such a relation, andconsequently the limitation of the world by void space, is nothing.Consequently, the world, as regards space, is not limited, that is, itis infinite in regard to extension.[52] [52] Space is merely the form of external intuition (formal intuition), and not a real object which can be externally perceived. Space, prior to all things which determine it (fill or limit it), or, rather, which present an empirical intuition conformable to it, is, under the title of absolute space, nothing but the mere possibility of external phenomena, in so far as they either exist in themselves, or can annex themselves to given intuitions. Empirical intuition is therefore not a composition of phenomena and space (of perception and empty intuition). The one is not the correlate of the other in a synthesis, but they are vitally connected in the same empirical intuition, as matter and form. If we wish to set one of these two apart from the other—space from phenomena—there arise all sorts of empty determinations of external intuition, which are very far from being possible perceptions. For example, motion or rest of the world in an infinite empty space, or a determination of the mutual relation of both, cannot possibly be perceived, and is therefore merely the predicate of a notional entity.OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.In bringing forward these conflicting arguments, I have not been on thesearch for sophisms, for the purpose of availing myself of specialpleading, which takes advantage of the carelessness of the oppositeparty, appeals to a misunderstood statute, and erects its unrighteousclaims upon an unfair interpretation. Both proofs originate fairly fromthe nature of the case, and the advantage presented by the mistakes ofthe dogmatists of both parties has been completely set aside.The thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated, by theintroduction of an erroneous conception of the infinity of a givenquantity. A quantity is infinite, if a greater than itself cannotpossibly exist. The quantity is measured by the number of givenunits—which are taken as a standard—contained in it. Now no number canbe the greatest, because one or more units can always be added. Itfollows that an infinite given quantity, consequently an infinite world(both as regards time and extension) is impossible. It is, therefore,limited in both respects. In this manner I might have conducted myproof; but the conception given in it does not agree with the trueconception of an infinite whole. In this there is no representation ofits quantity, it is not said how large it is; consequently itsconception is not the conception of a maximum. We cogitate in it merelyits relation to an arbitrarily assumed unit, in relation to which it isgreater than any number. Now, just as the unit which is taken isgreater or smaller, the infinite will be greater or smaller; but theinfinity, which consists merely in the relation to this given unit,must remain always the same, although the absolute quantity of thewhole is not thereby cognized.The true (transcendental) conception of infinity is: that thesuccessive synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum cannever be completed.[53] Hence it follows, without possibility ofmistake, that an eternity of actual successive states up to a given(the present) moment cannot have elapsed, and that the world musttherefore have a beginning. [53] The quantum in this sense contains a congeries of given units, which is greater than any number—and this is the mathematical conception of the infinite.In regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty as to aninfinite and yet elapsed series disappears; for the manifold of a worldinfinite in extension is contemporaneously given. But, in order tocogitate the total of this manifold, as we cannot have the aid oflimits constituting by themselves this total in intuition, we areobliged to give some account of our conception, which in this casecannot proceed from the whole to the determined quantity of the parts,but must demonstrate the possibility of a whole by means of asuccessive synthesis of the parts. But as this synthesis mustconstitute a series that cannot be completed, it is impossible for usto cogitate prior to it, and consequently not by means of it, atotality. For the conception of totality itself is in the present casethe representation of a completed synthesis of the parts; and thiscompletion, and consequently its conception, is impossible.ON THE ANTITHESIS.The proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and thecosmical content is based upon the consideration that, in the oppositecase, a void time and a void space must constitute the limits of theworld. Now I am not unaware, that there are some ways of escaping thisconclusion. It may, for example, be alleged, that a limit to the world,as regards both space and time, is quite possible, without at the sametime holding the existence of an absolute time before the beginning ofthe world, or an absolute space extending beyond the actual world—whichis impossible. I am quite well satisfied with the latter part of thisopinion of the philosophers of the Leibnitzian school. Space is merelythe form of external intuition, but not a real object which can itselfbe externally intuited; it is not a correlate of phenomena, it is theform of phenomena itself. Space, therefore, cannot be regarded asabsolutely and in itself something determinative of the existence ofthings, because it is not itself an object, but only the form ofpossible objects. Consequently, things, as phenomena, determine space;that is to say, they render it possible that, of all the possiblepredicates of space (size and relation), certain may belong to reality.But we cannot affirm the converse, that space, as somethingself-subsistent, can determine real things in regard to size or shape,for it is in itself not a real thing. Space (filled or void)[54] maytherefore be limited by phenomena, but phenomena cannot be limited byan empty space without them. This is true of time also. All this beinggranted, it is nevertheless indisputable, that we must assume these twononentities, void space without and void time before the world, if weassume the existence of cosmical limits, relatively to space or time. [54] It is evident that what is meant here is, that empty space, in so far as it is limited by phenomena—space, that is, within the world—does not at least contradict transcendental principles, and may therefore, as regards them, be admitted, although its possibility cannot on that account be affirmed.For, as regards the subterfuge adopted by those who endeavour to evadethe consequence—that, if the world is limited as to space and time, theinfinite void must determine the existence of actual things in regardto their dimensions—it arises solely from the fact that instead of asensuous world, an intelligible world—of which nothing is known—iscogitated; instead of a real beginning (an existence, which is precededby a period in which nothing exists), an existence which presupposes noother condition than that of time; and, instead of limits of extension,boundaries of the universe. But the question relates to the mundusphaenomenon, and its quantity; and in this case we cannot makeabstraction of the conditions of sensibility, without doing away withthe essential reality of this world itself. The world of sense, if itis limited, must necessarily lie in the infinite void. If this, andwith it space as the à priori condition of the possibility ofphenomena, is left out of view, the whole world of sense disappears. Inour problem is this alone considered as given. The mundusintelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world, inwhich abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition, and inrelation to which no synthetical proposition—either affirmative ornegative—is possible.SECOND CONFLICT OF TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.Every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts; andthere exists nothing that is not either itself simple, or composed ofsimple parts.PROOF.For, grant that composite substances do not consist of simple parts; inthis case, if all combination or composition were annihilated inthought, no composite part, and (as, by the supposition, there do notexist simple parts) no simple part would exist. Consequently, nosubstance; consequently, nothing would exist. Either, then, it isimpossible to annihilate composition in thought; or, after suchannihilation, there must remain something that subsists withoutcomposition, that is, something that is simple. But in the former casethe composite could not itself consist of substances, because withsubstances composition is merely a contingent relation, apart fromwhich they must still exist as self-subsistent beings. Now, as thiscase contradicts the supposition, the second must contain thetruth—that the substantial composite in the world consists of simpleparts.It follows, as an immediate inference, that the things in the world areall, without exception, simple beings—that composition is merely anexternal condition pertaining to them—and that, although we never canseparate and isolate the elementary substances from the state ofcomposition, reason must cogitate these as the primary subjects of allcomposition, and consequently, as prior thereto—and as simplesubstances.ANTITHESIS.No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts; and theredoes not exist in the world any simple substance.PROOF.Let it be supposed that a composite thing (as substance) consists ofsimple parts. Inasmuch as all external relation, consequently allcomposition of substances, is possible only in space; the space,occupied by that which is composite, must consist of the same number ofparts as is contained in the composite. But space does not consist ofsimple parts, but of spaces. Therefore, every part of the compositemust occupy a space. But the absolutely primary parts of what iscomposite are simple. It follows that what is simple occupies a space.Now, as everything real that occupies a space, contains a manifold theparts of which are external to each other, and is consequentlycomposite—and a real composite, not of accidents (for these cannotexist external to each other apart from substance), but ofsubstances—it follows that the simple must be a substantial composite,which is self-contradictory.The second proposition of the antithesis—that there exists in the worldnothing that is simple—is here equivalent to the following: Theexistence of the absolutely simple cannot be demonstrated from anyexperience or perception either external or internal; and theabsolutely simple is a mere idea, the objective reality of which cannotbe demonstrated in any possible experience; it is consequently, in theexposition of phenomena, without application and object. For, let ustake for granted that an object may be found in experience for thistranscendental idea; the empirical intuition of such an object mustthen be recognized to contain absolutely no manifold with its partsexternal to each other, and connected into unity. Now, as we cannotreason from the non-consciousness of such a manifold to theimpossibility of its existence in the intuition of an object, and asthe proof of this impossibility is necessary for the establishment andproof of absolute simplicity; it follows that this simplicity cannot beinferred from any perception whatever. As, therefore, an absolutelysimple object cannot be given in any experience, and the world of sensemust be considered as the sum total of all possible experiences:nothing simple exists in the world.This second proposition in the antithesis has a more extended aim thanthe first. The first merely banishes the simple from the intuition ofthe composite; while the second drives it entirely out of nature. Hencewe were unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given objectof external intuition (of the composite), but we were obliged to proveit from the relation of a given object to a possible experience ingeneral.OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND ANTINOMY. THESIS.When I speak of a whole, which necessarily consists of simple parts, Iunderstand thereby only a substantial whole, as the true composite;that is to say, I understand that contingent unity of the manifoldwhich is given as perfectly isolated (at least in thought), placed inreciprocal connection, and thus constituted a unity. Space ought not tobe called a compositum but a totum, for its parts are possible in thewhole, and not the whole by means of the parts. It might perhaps becalled a compositum ideale, but not a compositum reale. But this is ofno importance. As space is not a composite of substances (and not evenof real accidents), if I abstract all composition therein—nothing, noteven a point, remains; for a point is possible only as the limit of aspace—consequently of a composite. Space and time, therefore, do notconsist of simple parts. That which belongs only to the condition orstate of a substance, even although it possesses a quantity (motion orchange, for example), likewise does not consist of simple parts. Thatis to say, a certain degree of change does not originate from theaddition of many simple changes. Our inference of the simple from thecomposite is valid only of self-subsisting things. But the accidents ofa state are not self-subsistent. The proof, then, for the necessity ofthe simple, as the component part of all that is substantial andcomposite, may prove a failure, and the whole case of this thesis belost, if we carry the proposition too far, and wish to make it valid ofeverything that is composite without distinction—as indeed has reallynow and then happened. Besides, I am here speaking only of the simple,in so far as it is necessarily given in the composite—the latter beingcapable of solution into the former as its component parts. The propersignification of the word monas (as employed by Leibnitz) ought torelate to the simple, given immediately as simple substance (forexample, in consciousness), and not as an element of the composite. Asan clement, the term atomus would be more appropriate. And as I wish toprove the existence of simple substances, only in relation to, and asthe elements of, the composite, I might term the antithesis of thesecond Antinomy, transcendental Atomistic. But as this word has longbeen employed to designate a particular theory of corporeal phenomena(moleculae), and thus presupposes a basis of empirical conceptions, Iprefer calling it the dialectical principle of Monadology.ANTITHESIS.Against the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whoseground of proof is purely mathematical, objections have been alleged bythe Monadists. These objections lay themselves open, at first sight, tosuspicion, from the fact that they do not recognize the clearestmathematical proofs as propositions relating to the constitution ofspace, in so far as it is really the formal condition of thepossibility of all matter, but regard them merely as inferences fromabstract but arbitrary conceptions, which cannot have any applicationto real things. Just as if it were possible to imagine another mode ofintuition than that given in the primitive intuition of space; and justas if its à priori determinations did not apply to everything, theexistence of which is possible, from the fact alone of its fillingspace. If we listen to them, we shall find ourselves required tocogitate, in addition to the mathematical point, which is simple—not,however, a part, but a mere limit of space—physical points, which areindeed likewise simple, but possess the peculiar property, as parts ofspace, of filling it merely by their aggregation. I shall not repeathere the common and clear refutations of this absurdity, which are tobe found everywhere in numbers: every one knows that it is impossibleto undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere discursiveconceptions; I shall only remark that, if in this case philosophyendeavours to gain an advantage over mathematics by sophisticalartifices, it is because it forgets that the discussion relates solelyto Phenomena and their conditions. It is not sufficient to find theconception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite, butwe must discover for the intuition of the composite (matter), theintuition of the simple. Now this, according to the laws ofsensibility, and consequently in the case of objects of sense, isutterly impossible. In the case of a whole composed of substances,which is cogitated solely by the pure understanding, it may benecessary to be in possession of the simple before composition ispossible. But this does not hold good of the Totum substantialephaenomenon, which, as an empirical intuition in space, possesses thenecessary property of containing no simple part, for the very reasonthat no part of space is simple. Meanwhile, the Monadists have beensubtle enough to escape from this difficulty, by presupposing intuitionand the dynamical relation of substances as the condition of thepossibility of space, instead of regarding space as the condition ofthe possibility of the objects of external intuition, that is, ofbodies. Now we have a conception of bodies only as phenomena, and, assuch, they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of allexternal phenomena. The evasion is therefore in vain; as, indeed, wehave sufficiently shown in our Æsthetic. If bodies were things inthemselves, the proof of the Monadists would be unexceptionable.The second dialectical assertion possesses the peculiarity of havingopposed to it a dogmatical proposition, which, among all suchsophistical statements, is the only one that undertakes to prove in thecase of an object of experience, that which is properly atranscendental idea—the absolute simplicity of substance. Theproposition is that the object of the internal sense, the thinking Ego,is an absolute simple substance. Without at present entering upon thissubject—as it has been considered at length in a former chapter—I shallmerely remark that, if something is cogitated merely as an object,without the addition of any synthetical determination of itsintuition—as happens in the case of the bare representation, I—it iscertain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such arepresentation. As, moreover, the predicates whereby I cogitate thisobject are merely intuitions of the internal sense, there cannot bediscovered in them anything to prove the existence of a manifold whoseparts are external to each other, and, consequently, nothing to provethe existence of real composition. Consciousness, therefore, is soconstituted that, inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same timeits own object, it cannot divide itself—although it can divide itsinhering determinations. For every object in relation to itself isabsolute unity. Nevertheless, if the subject is regarded externally, asan object of intuition, it must, in its character of phenomenon,possess the property of composition. And it must always be regarded inthis manner, if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained init a manifold whose parts are external to each other.THIRD CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.Causality according to the laws of nature, is not the only causalityoperating to originate the phenomena of the world. A causality offreedom is also necessary to account fully for these phenomena.PROOF.Let it be supposed, that there is no other kind of causality than thataccording to the laws of nature. Consequently, everything that happenspresupposes a previous condition, which it follows with absolutecertainty, in conformity with a rule. But this previous condition mustitself be something that has happened (that has arisen in time, as itdid not exist before), for, if it has always been in existence, itsconsequence or effect would not thus originate for the first time, butwould likewise have always existed. The causality, therefore, of acause, whereby something happens, is itself a thing that has happened.Now this again presupposes, in conformity with the law of nature, aprevious condition and its causality, and this another anterior to theformer, and so on. If, then, everything happens solely in accordancewith the laws of nature, there cannot be any real first beginning ofthings, but only a subaltern or comparative beginning. There cannot,therefore, be a completeness of series on the side of the causes whichoriginate the one from the other. But the law of nature is that nothingcan happen without a sufficient à priori determined cause. Theproposition therefore—if all causality is possible only in accordancewith the laws of nature—is, when stated in this unlimited and generalmanner, self-contradictory. It follows that this cannot be the onlykind of causality.From what has been said, it follows that a causality must be admitted,by means of which something happens, without its cause being determinedaccording to necessary laws by some other cause preceding. That is tosay, there must exist an absolute spontaneity of cause, which of itselforiginates a series of phenomena which proceeds according to naturallaws—consequently transcendental freedom, without which even in thecourse of nature the succession of phenomena on the side of causes isnever complete.ANTITHESIS.There is no such thing as freedom, but everything in the world happenssolely according to the laws of nature.PROOF.Granted, that there does exist freedom in the transcendental sense, asa peculiar kind of causality, operating to produce events in theworld—a faculty, that is to say, of originating a state, andconsequently a series of consequences from that state. In this case,not only the series originated by this spontaneity, but thedetermination of this spontaneity itself to the production of theseries, that is to say, the causality itself must have an absolutecommencement, such that nothing can precede to determine this actionaccording to unvarying laws. But every beginning of action presupposesin the acting cause a state of inaction; and a dynamically primalbeginning of action presupposes a state, which has no connection—asregards causality—with the preceding state of the cause—which does not,that is, in any wise result from it. Transcendental freedom istherefore opposed to the natural law of cause and effect, and such aconjunction of successive states in effective causes is destructive ofthe possibility of unity in experience and for that reason not to befound in experience—is consequently a mere fiction of thought.We have, therefore, nothing but nature to which we must look forconnection and order in cosmical events. Freedom—independence of thelaws of nature—is certainly a deliverance from restraint, but it isalso a relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule. For it cannot bealleged that, instead of the laws of nature, laws of freedom may beintroduced into the causality of the course of nature. For, if freedomwere determined according to laws, it would be no longer freedom, butmerely nature. Nature, therefore, and transcendental freedom aredistinguishable as conformity to law and lawlessness. The formerimposes upon understanding the difficulty of seeking the origin ofevents ever higher and higher in the series of causes, inasmuch ascausality is always conditioned thereby; while it compensates thislabour by the guarantee of a unity complete and in conformity with law.The latter, on the contrary, holds out to the understanding the promiseof a point of rest in the chain of causes, by conducting it to anunconditioned causality, which professes to have the power ofspontaneous origination, but which, in its own utter blindness,deprives it of the guidance of rules, by which alone a completelyconnected experience is possible.OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.The transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entirecontent of the psychological conception so termed, which is for themost part empirical. It merely presents us with the conception ofspontaneity of action, as the proper ground for imputing freedom to thecause of a certain class of objects. It is, however, the truestumbling-stone to philosophy, which meets with unconquerabledifficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of unconditionedcausality. That element in the question of the freedom of the will,which has for so long a time placed speculative reason in suchperplexity, is properly only transcendental, and concerns the question,whether there must be held to exist a faculty of spontaneousorigination of a series of successive things or states. How such afaculty is possible is not a necessary inquiry; for in the case ofnatural causality itself, we are obliged to content ourselves with theà priori knowledge that such a causality must be presupposed, althoughwe are quite incapable of comprehending how the being of one thing ispossible through the being of another, but must for this informationlook entirely to experience. Now we have demonstrated this necessity ofa free first beginning of a series of phenomena, only in so far as itis required for the comprehension of an origin of the world, allfollowing states being regarded as a succession according to laws ofnature alone. But, as there has thus been proved the existence of afaculty which can of itself originate a series in time—although we areunable to explain how it can exist—we feel ourselves authorized toadmit, even in the midst of the natural course of events, a beginning,as regards causality, of different successions of phenomena, and at thesame time to attribute to all substances a faculty of free action. Butwe ought in this case not to allow ourselves to fall into a commonmisunderstanding, and to suppose that, because a successive series inthe world can only have a comparatively first beginning—another stateor condition of things always preceding—an absolutely first beginningof a series in the course of nature is impossible. For we are notspeaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time, butas regards causality alone. When, for example, I, completely of my ownfree will, and independently of the necessarily determinative influenceof natural causes, rise from my chair, there commences with this event,including its material consequences in infinitum, an absolutely newseries; although, in relation to time, this event is merely thecontinuation of a preceding series. For this resolution and act of minedo not form part of the succession of effects in nature, and are notmere continuations of it; on the contrary, the determining causes ofnature cease to operate in reference to this event, which certainlysucceeds the acts of nature, but does not proceed from them. For thesereasons, the action of a free agent must be termed, in regard tocausality, if not in relation to time, an absolutely primal beginningof a series of phenomena.The justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as thefirst beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from thefact, that all philosophers of antiquity (with the exception of theEpicurean school) felt themselves obliged, when constructing a theoryof the motions of the universe, to accept a prime mover, that is, afreely acting cause, which spontaneously and prior to all other causesevolved this series of states. They always felt the need of goingbeyond mere nature, for the purpose of making a first beginningcomprehensible.ON THE ANTITHESIS.The assertor of the all-sufficiency of nature in regard to causality(transcendental Physiocracy), in opposition to the doctrine of freedom,would defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner.He would say, in answer to the sophistical arguments of the oppositeparty: If you do not accept a mathematical first, in relation to time,you have no need to seek a dynamical first, in regard to causality. Whocompelled you to imagine an absolutely primal condition of the world,and therewith an absolute beginning of the gradually progressingsuccessions of phenomena—and, as some foundation for this fancy ofyours, to set bounds to unlimited nature? Inasmuch as the substances inthe world have always existed—at least the unity of experience renderssuch a supposition quite necessary—there is no difficulty in believingalso, that the changes in the conditions of these substances havealways existed; and, consequently, that a first beginning, mathematicalor dynamical, is by no means required. The possibility of such aninfinite derivation, without any initial member from which all theothers result, is certainly quite incomprehensible. But, if you arerash enough to deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason,you will find yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of manyfundamental properties of natural objects (such as fundamental forces),which you can just as little comprehend; and even the possibility of sosimple a conception as that of change must present to you insuperabledifficulties. For if experience did not teach you that it was real, younever could conceive à priori the possibility of this ceaselesssequence of being and non-being.But if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom isgranted—a faculty of originating changes in the world—this faculty mustat least exist out of and apart from the world; although it iscertainly a bold assumption, that, over and above the complete contentof all possible intuitions, there still exists an object which cannotbe presented in any possible perception. But, to attribute tosubstances in the world itself such a faculty, is quite inadmissible;for, in this case; the connection of phenomena reciprocally determiningand determined according to general laws, which is termed nature, andalong with it the criteria of empirical truth, which enable us todistinguish experience from mere visionary dreaming, would almostentirely disappear. In proximity with such a lawless faculty offreedom, a system of nature is hardly cogitable; for the laws of thelatter would be continually subject to the intrusive influences of theformer, and the course of phenomena, which would otherwise proceedregularly and uniformly, would become thereby confused anddisconnected.FOURTH CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.There exists either in, or in connection with the world—either as apart of it, or as the cause of it—an absolutely necessary being.PROOF.The world of sense, as the sum total of all phenomena, contains aseries of changes. For, without such a series, the mentalrepresentation of the series of time itself, as the condition of thepossibility of the sensuous world, could not be presented to us.[55]But every change stands under its condition, which precedes it in timeand renders it necessary. Now the existence of a given conditionpresupposes a complete series of conditions up to the absolutelyunconditioned, which alone is absolutely necessary. It follows thatsomething that is absolutely necessary must exist, if change exists asits consequence. But this necessary thing itself belongs to thesensuous world. For suppose it to exist out of and apart from it, theseries of cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning, and yetthis necessary cause would not itself belong to the world of sense. Butthis is impossible. For, as the beginning of a series in time isdetermined only by that which precedes it in time, the supremecondition of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in thetime in which this series itself did not exist; for a beginningsupposes a time preceding, in which the thing that begins to be was notin existence. The causality of the necessary cause of changes, andconsequently the cause itself, must for these reasons belong totime—and to phenomena, time being possible only as the form ofphenomena. Consequently, it cannot be cogitated as separated from theworld of sense—the sum total of all phenomena. There is, therefore,contained in the world, something that is absolutely necessary—whetherit be the whole cosmical series itself, or only a part of it. [55] Objectively, time, as the formal condition of the possibility of change, precedes all changes; but subjectively, and in consciousness, the representation of time, like every other, is given solely by occasion of perception.ANTITHESIS.An absolutely necessary being does not exist, either in the world, orout of it—as its cause.PROOF.Grant that either the world itself is necessary, or that there iscontained in it a necessary existence. Two cases are possible. First,there must either be in the series of cosmical changes a beginning,which is unconditionally necessary, and therefore uncaused—which is atvariance with the dynamical law of the determination of all phenomenain time; or, secondly, the series itself is without beginning, and,although contingent and conditioned in all its parts, is neverthelessabsolutely necessary and unconditioned as a whole—which isself-contradictory. For the existence of an aggregate cannot benecessary, if no single part of it possesses necessary existence.Grant, on the other hand, that an absolutely necessary cause exists outof and apart from the world. This cause, as the highest member in theseries of the causes of cosmical changes, must originate or begin[56]the existence of the latter and their series. In this case it must alsobegin to act, and its causality would therefore belong to time, andconsequently to the sum total of phenomena, that is, to the world. Itfollows that the cause cannot be out of the world; which iscontradictory to the hypothesis. Therefore, neither in the world, norout of it (but in causal connection with it), does there exist anyabsolutely necessary being. [56] The word begin is taken in two senses. The first is active—the cause being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect (infit). The second is passive—the causality in the cause itself beginning to operate (fit). I reason here from the first to the second.OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOURTH ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.To demonstrate the existence of a necessary being, I cannot bepermitted in this place to employ any other than the cosmologicalargument, which ascends from the conditioned in phenomena to theunconditioned in conception—the unconditioned being considered thenecessary condition of the absolute totality of the series. The proof,from the mere idea of a supreme being, belongs to another principle ofreason and requires separate discussion.The pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessarybeing, but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled, whether thisbeing is the world itself, or quite distinct from it. To establish thetruth of the latter view, principles are requisite, which are notcosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena. We shouldrequire to introduce into our proof conceptions of contingentbeings—regarded merely as objects of the understanding, and also aprinciple which enables us to connect these, by means of mereconceptions, with a necessary being. But the proper place for all sucharguments is a transcendent philosophy, which has unhappily not yetbeen established.But, if we begin our proof cosmologically, by laying at the foundationof it the series of phenomena, and the regress in it according toempirical laws of causality, we are not at liberty to break off fromthis mode of demonstration and to pass over to something which is notitself a member of the series. The condition must be taken in exactlythe same signification as the relation of the conditioned to itscondition in the series has been taken, for the series must conduct usin an unbroken regress to this supreme condition. But if this relationis sensuous, and belongs to the possible empirical employment ofunderstanding, the supreme condition or cause must close the regressiveseries according to the laws of sensibility and consequently, mustbelong to the series of time. It follows that this necessary existencemust be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series.Certain philosophers have, nevertheless, allowed themselves the libertyof making such a saltus (metabasis eis allo gonos). From the changes inthe world they have concluded their empirical contingency, that is,their dependence on empirically-determined causes, and they thusadmitted an ascending series of empirical conditions: and in this theyare quite right. But as they could not find in this series any primalbeginning or any highest member, they passed suddenly from theempirical conception of contingency to the pure category, whichpresents us with a series—not sensuous, but intellectual—whosecompleteness does certainly rest upon the existence of an absolutelynecessary cause. Nay, more, this intellectual series is not tied to anysensuous conditions; and is therefore free from the condition of time,which requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time. Butsuch a procedure is perfectly inadmissible, as will be made plain fromwhat follows.In the pure sense of the categories, that is contingent thecontradictory opposite of which is possible. Now we cannot reason fromempirical contingency to intellectual. The opposite of that which ischanged—the opposite of its state—is actual at another time, and istherefore possible. Consequently, it is not the contradictory oppositeof the former state. To be that, it is necessary that, in the same timein which the preceding state existed, its opposite could have existedin its place; but such a cognition is not given us in the merephenomenon of change. A body that was in motion = A, comes into a stateof rest = non-A. Now it cannot be concluded from the fact that a stateopposite to the state A follows it, that the contradictory opposite ofA is possible; and that A is therefore contingent. To prove this, weshould require to know that the state of rest could have existed in thevery same time in which the motion took place. Now we know nothing morethan that the state of rest was actual in the time that followed thestate of motion; consequently, that it was also possible. But motion atone time, and rest at another time, are not contradictorily opposed toeach other. It follows from what has been said that the succession ofopposite determinations, that is, change, does not demonstrate the factof contingency as represented in the conceptions of the pureunderstanding; and that it cannot, therefore, conduct us to the fact ofthe existence of a necessary being. Change proves merely empiricalcontingency, that is to say, that the new state could not have existedwithout a cause, which belongs to the preceding time. This cause—evenalthough it is regarded as absolutely necessary—must be presented to usin time, and must belong to the series of phenomena.ON THE ANTITHESIS.The difficulties which meet us, in our attempt to rise through theseries of phenomena to the existence of an absolutely necessary supremecause, must not originate from our inability to establish the truth ofour mere conceptions of the necessary existence of a thing. That is tosay, our objections not be ontological, but must be directed againstthe causal connection with a series of phenomena of a condition whichis itself unconditioned. In one word, they must be cosmological andrelate to empirical laws. We must show that the regress in the seriesof causes (in the world of sense) cannot conclude with an empiricallyunconditioned condition, and that the cosmological argument from thecontingency of the cosmical state—a contingency alleged to arise fromchange—does not justify us in accepting a first cause, that is, a primeoriginator of the cosmical series.The reader will observe in this antinomy a very remarkable contrast.The very same grounds of proof which established in the thesis theexistence of a supreme being, demonstrated in the antithesis—and withequal strictness—the non-existence of such a being. We found, first,that a necessary being exists, because the whole time past contains theseries of all conditions, and with it, therefore, the unconditioned(the necessary); secondly, that there does not exist any necessarybeing, for the same reason, that the whole time past contains theseries of all conditions—which are themselves, therefore, in theaggregate, conditioned. The cause of this seeming incongruity is asfollows. We attend, in the first argument, solely to the absolutetotality of the series of conditions, the one of which determines theother in time, and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned. In thesecond, we consider, on the contrary, the contingency of everythingthat is determined in the series of time—for every event is preceded bya time, in which the condition itself must be determined asconditioned—and thus everything that is unconditioned or absolutelynecessary disappears. In both, the mode of proof is quite in accordancewith the common procedure of human reason, which often falls intodiscord with itself, from considering an object from two differentpoints of view. Herr von Mairan regarded the controversy between twocelebrated astronomers, which arose from a similar difficulty as to thechoice of a proper standpoint, as a phenomenon of sufficient importanceto warrant a separate treatise on the subject. The one concluded: themoon revolves on its own axis, because it constantly presents the sameside to the earth; the other declared that the moon does not revolve onits own axis, for the same reason. Both conclusions were perfectlycorrect, according to the point of view from which the motions of themoon were considered.Section III. Of the Interest of Reason in these Self-contradictionsWe have thus completely before us the dialectical procedure of thecosmological ideas. No possible experience can present us with anobject adequate to them in extent. Nay, more, reason itself cannotcogitate them as according with the general laws of experience. And yetthey are not arbitrary fictions of thought. On the contrary, reason, inits uninterrupted progress in the empirical synthesis, is necessarilyconducted to them, when it endeavours to free from all conditions andto comprehend in its unconditioned totality that which can only bedetermined conditionally in accordance with the laws of experience.These dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve fournatural and unavoidable problems of reason. There are neither more, norcan there be less, than this number, because there are no other seriesof synthetical hypotheses, limiting à priori the empirical synthesis.The brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyondthe limits of experience, have been represented above only in dryformulae, which contain merely the grounds of its pretensions. Theyhave, besides, in conformity with the character of a transcendentalphilosophy, been freed from every empirical element; although the fullsplendour of the promises they hold out, and the anticipations theyexcite, manifests itself only when in connection with empiricalcognitions. In the application of them, however, and in the advancingenlargement of the employment of reason, while struggling to rise fromthe region of experience and to soar to those sublime ideas, philosophydiscovers a value and a dignity, which, if it could but make good itsassertions, would raise it far above all other departments of humanknowledge—professing, as it does, to present a sure foundation for ourhighest hopes and the ultimate aims of all the exertions of reason. Thequestions: whether the world has a beginning and a limit to itsextension in space; whether there exists anywhere, or perhaps, in myown thinking Self, an indivisible and indestructible unity—or whethernothing but what is divisible and transitory exists; whether I am afree agent, or, like other beings, am bound in the chains of nature andfate; whether, finally, there is a supreme cause of the world, or allour thought and speculation must end with nature and the order ofexternal things—are questions for the solution of which themathematician would willingly exchange his whole science; for in itthere is no satisfaction for the highest aspirations and most ardentdesires of humanity. Nay, it may even be said that the true value ofmathematics—that pride of human reason—consists in this: that sheguides reason to the knowledge of nature—in her greater as well as inher less manifestations—in her beautiful order and regularity—guidesher, moreover, to an insight into the wonderful unity of the movingforces in the operations of nature, far beyond the expectations of aphilosophy building only on experience; and that she thus encouragesphilosophy to extend the province of reason beyond all experience, andat the same time provides it with the most excellent materials forsupporting its investigations, in so far as their nature admits, byadequate and accordant intuitions.Unfortunately for speculation—but perhaps fortunately for the practicalinterests of humanity—reason, in the midst of her highestanticipations, finds herself hemmed in by a press of opposite andcontradictory conclusions, from which neither her honour nor her safetywill permit her to draw back. Nor can she regard these conflictingtrains of reasoning with indifference as mere passages at arms, stillless can she command peace; for in the subject of the conflict she hasa deep interest. There is no other course left open to her than toreflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in reason—whetherit may not arise from a mere misunderstanding. After such an inquiry,arrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides; but thesovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upona sure foundation.We shall at present defer this radical inquiry and, in the meantime,consider for a little what side in the controversy we should mostwillingly take, if we were obliged to become partisans at all. As, inthis case, we leave out of sight altogether the logical criterion oftruth, and merely consult our own interest in reference to thequestion, these considerations, although inadequate to settle thequestion of right in either party, will enable us to comprehend howthose who have taken part in the struggle, adopt the one view ratherthan the other—no special insight into the subject, however, havinginfluenced their choice. They will, at the same time, explain to usmany other things by the way—for example, the fiery zeal on the oneside and the cold maintenance of their cause on the other; why the oneparty has met with the warmest approbations, and the other has alwaysbeen repulsed by irreconcilable prejudices.There is one thing, however, that determines the proper point of view,from which alone this preliminary inquiry can be instituted and carriedon with the proper completeness—and that is the comparison of theprinciples from which both sides, thesis and antithesis, proceed. Myreaders would remark in the propositions of the antithesis a completeuniformity in the mode of thought and a perfect unity of principle. Itsprinciple was that of pure empiricism, not only in the explication ofthe phenomena in the world, but also in the solution of thetranscendental ideas, even of that of the universe itself. Theaffirmations of the thesis, on the contrary, were based, in addition tothe empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena,on intellectual propositions; and its principles were in so far notsimple. I shall term the thesis, in view of its essentialcharacteristic, the dogmatism of pure reason.On the side of Dogmatism, or of the thesis, therefore, in thedetermination of the cosmological ideas, we find:1. A practical interest, which must be very dear to everyright-thinking man. That the word has a beginning—that the nature of mythinking self is simple, and therefore indestructible—that I am a freeagent, and raised above the compulsion of nature and her laws—and,finally, that the entire order of things, which form the world, isdependent upon a Supreme Being, from whom the whole receives unity andconnection—these are so many foundation-stones of morality andreligion. The antithesis deprives us of all these supports—or, atleast, seems so to deprive us.2. A speculative interest of reason manifests itself on this side. For,if we take the transcendental ideas and employ them in the manner whichthe thesis directs, we can exhibit completely à priori the entire chainof conditions, and understand the derivation of theconditioned—beginning from the unconditioned. This the antithesis doesnot do; and for this reason does not meet with so welcome a reception.For it can give no answer to our question respecting the conditions ofits synthesis—except such as must be supplemented by another question,and so on to infinity. According to it, we must rise from a givenbeginning to one still higher; every part conducts us to a stillsmaller one; every event is preceded by another event which is itscause; and the conditions of existence rest always upon other and stillhigher conditions, and find neither end nor basis in someself-subsistent thing as the primal being.3. This side has also the advantage of popularity; and this constitutesno small part of its claim to favour. The common understanding does notfind the least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning ofall synthesis—accustomed, as it is, rather to follow our consequencesthan to seek for a proper basis for cognition. In the conception of anabsolute first, moreover—the possibility of which it does not inquireinto—it is highly gratified to find a firmly-established point ofdeparture for its attempts at theory; while in the restless andcontinuous ascent from the conditioned to the condition, always withone foot in the air, it can find no satisfaction.On the side of the antithesis, or Empiricism, in the determination ofthe cosmological ideas:1. We cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pureprinciples of reason as morality and religion present. On the contrary,pure empiricism seems to empty them of all their power and influence.If there does not exist a Supreme Being distinct from the world—if theworld is without beginning, consequently without a Creator—if our willsare not free, and the soul is divisible and subject to corruption justlike matter—the ideas and principles of morality lose all validity andfall with the transcendental ideas which constituted their theoreticalsupport.2. But empiricism, in compensation, holds out to reason, in itsspeculative interests, certain important advantages, far exceeding anythat the dogmatist can promise us. For, when employed by theempiricist, understanding is always upon its proper ground ofinvestigation—the field of possible experience, the laws of which itcan explore, and thus extend its cognition securely and with clearintelligence without being stopped by limits in any direction. Here canit and ought it to find and present to intuition its proper object—notonly in itself, but in all its relations; or, if it employ conceptions,upon this ground it can always present the corresponding images inclear and unmistakable intuitions. It is quite unnecessary for it torenounce the guidance of nature, to attach itself to ideas, the objectsof which it cannot know; because, as mere intellectual entities, theycannot be presented in any intuition. On the contrary, it is not evenpermitted to abandon its proper occupation, under the pretence that ithas been brought to a conclusion (for it never can be), and to passinto the region of idealizing reason and transcendent conceptions,which it is not required to observe and explore the laws of nature, butmerely to think and to imagine—secure from being contradicted by facts,because they have not been called as witnesses, but passed by, orperhaps subordinated to the so-called higher interests andconsiderations of pure reason.Hence the empiricist will never allow himself to accept any epoch ofnature for the first—the absolutely primal state; he will not believethat there can be limits to his outlook into her wide domains, nor passfrom the objects of nature, which he can satisfactorily explain bymeans of observation and mathematical thought—which he can determinesynthetically in intuition, to those which neither sense norimagination can ever present in concreto; he will not concede theexistence of a faculty in nature, operating independently of the lawsof nature—a concession which would introduce uncertainty into theprocedure of the understanding, which is guided by necessary laws tothe observation of phenomena; nor, finally, will he permit himself toseek a cause beyond nature, inasmuch as we know nothing but it, andfrom it alone receive an objective basis for all our conceptions andinstruction in the unvarying laws of things.In truth, if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose in theestablishment of his antithesis than to check the presumption of areason which mistakes its true destination, which boasts of its insightand its knowledge, just where all insight and knowledge cease to exist,and regards that which is valid only in relation to a practicalinterest, as an advancement of the speculative interests of the mind(in order, when it is convenient for itself, to break the thread of ourphysical investigations, and, under pretence of extending ourcognition, connect them with transcendental ideas, by means of which wereally know only that we know nothing)—if, I say, the empiricist restedsatisfied with this benefit, the principle advanced by him would be amaxim recommending moderation in the pretensions of reason and modestyin its affirmations, and at the same time would direct us to the rightmode of extending the province of the understanding, by the help of theonly true teacher, experience. In obedience to this advice,intellectual hypotheses and faith would not be called in aid of ourpractical interests; nor should we introduce them under the pompoustitles of science and insight. For speculative cognition cannot find anobjective basis any other where than in experience; and, when weoverstep its limits our synthesis, which requires ever new cognitionsindependent of experience, has no substratum of intuition upon which tobuild.But if—as often happens—empiricism, in relation to ideas, becomesitself dogmatic and boldly denies that which is above the sphere of itsphenomenal cognition, it falls itself into the error of intemperance—anerror which is here all the more reprehensible, as thereby thepractical interest of reason receives an irreparable injury.And this constitutes the opposition between Epicureanism[57] andPlatonism. [57] It is, however, still a matter of doubt whether Epicurus ever propounded these principles as directions for the objective employment of the understanding. If, indeed, they were nothing more than maxims for the speculative exercise of reason, he gives evidence therein a more genuine philosophic spirit than any of the philosophers of antiquity. That, in the explanation of phenomena, we must proceed as if the field of inquiry had neither limits in space nor commencement in time; that we must be satisfied with the teaching of experience in reference to the material of which the world is posed; that we must not look for any other mode of the origination of events than that which is determined by the unalterable laws of nature; and finally, that we not employ the hypothesis of a cause distinct from the world to account for a phenomenon or for the world itself—are principles for the extension of speculative philosophy, and the discovery of the true sources of the principles of morals, which, however little conformed to in the present day, are undoubtedly correct. At the same time, any one desirous of ignoring, in mere speculation, these dogmatical propositions, need not for that reason be accused of denying them.Both Epicurus and Plato assert more in their systems than they know.The former encourages and advances science—although to the prejudice ofthe practical; the latter presents us with excellent principles for theinvestigation of the practical, but, in relation to everythingregarding which we can attain to speculative cognition, permits reasonto append idealistic explanations of natural phenomena, to the greatinjury of physical investigation.3. In regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a partyin this war of assertions, it seems very extraordinary that empiricismshould be utterly unpopular. We should be inclined to believe that thecommon understanding would receive it with pleasure—promising as itdoes to satisfy it without passing the bounds of experience and itsconnected order; while transcendental dogmatism obliges it to rise toconceptions which far surpass the intelligence and ability of the mostpractised thinkers. But in this, in truth, is to be found its realmotive. For the common understanding thus finds itself in a situationwhere not even the most learned can have the advantage of it. If itunderstands little or nothing about these transcendental conceptions,no one can boast of understanding any more; and although it may notexpress itself in so scholastically correct a manner as others, it canbusy itself with reasoning and arguments without end, wandering amongmere ideas, about which one can always be very eloquent, because weknow nothing about them; while, in the observation and investigation ofnature, it would be forced to remain dumb and to confess its utterignorance. Thus indolence and vanity form of themselves strongrecommendations of these principles. Besides, although it is a hardthing for a philosopher to assume a principle, of which he can give tohimself no reasonable account, and still more to employ conceptions,the objective reality of which cannot be established, nothing is moreusual with the common understanding. It wants something which willallow it to go to work with confidence. The difficulty of evencomprehending a supposition does not disquiet it, because—not knowingwhat comprehending means—it never even thinks of the supposition it maybe adopting as a principle; and regards as known that with which it hasbecome familiar from constant use. And, at last, all speculativeinterests disappear before the practical interests which it holds dear;and it fancies that it understands and knows what its necessities andhopes incite it to assume or to believe. Thus the empiricism oftranscendentally idealizing reason is robbed of all popularity; and,however prejudicial it may be to the highest practical principles,there is no fear that it will ever pass the limits of the schools, oracquire any favour or influence in society or with the multitude.Human reason is by nature architectonic. That is to say, it regards allcognitions as parts of a possible system, and hence accepts only suchprinciples as at least do not incapacitate a cognition to which we mayhave attained from being placed along with others in a general system.But the propositions of the antithesis are of a character which rendersthe completion of an edifice of cognitions impossible. According tothese, beyond one state or epoch of the world there is always to befound one more ancient; in every part always other parts themselvesdivisible; preceding every event another, the origin of which mustitself be sought still higher; and everything in existence isconditioned, and still not dependent on an unconditioned and primalexistence. As, therefore, the antithesis will not concede the existenceof a first beginning which might be available as a foundation, acomplete edifice of cognition, in the presence of such hypothesis, isutterly impossible. Thus the architectonic interest of reason, whichrequires a unity—not empirical, but à priori and rational—forms anatural recommendation for the assertions of the thesis in ourantinomy.But if any one could free himself entirely from all considerations ofinterest, and weigh without partiality the assertions of reason,attending only to their content, irrespective of the consequences whichfollow from them; such a person, on the supposition that he knew noother way out of the confusion than to settle the truth of one or otherof the conflicting doctrines, would live in a state of continualhesitation. Today, he would feel convinced that the human will is free;to-morrow, considering the indissoluble chain of nature, he would lookon freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be all-in-all. But,if he were called to action, the play of the merely speculative reasonwould disappear like the shapes of a dream, and practical interestwould dictate his choice of principles. But, as it well befits areflective and inquiring being to devote certain periods of time to theexamination of its own reason—to divest itself of all partiality, andfrankly to communicate its observations for the judgement and opinionof others; so no one can be blamed for, much less prevented from,placing both parties on their trial, with permission to end themselves,free from intimidation, before intimidation, before a sworn jury ofequal condition with themselves—the condition of weak and fallible men.Section IV. Of the necessity imposed upon Pure Reason of presenting aSolution of its Transcendental ProblemsTo avow an ability to solve all problems and to answer all questionswould be a profession certain to convict any philosopher of extravagantboasting and self-conceit, and at once to destroy the confidence thatmight otherwise have been reposed in him. There are, however, sciencesso constituted that every question arising within their sphere mustnecessarily be capable of receiving an answer from the knowledgealready possessed, for the answer must be received from the samesources whence the question arose. In such sciences it is not allowableto excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable ignorance;a solution is absolutely requisite. The rule of right and wrong musthelp us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possiblecases; otherwise, the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null,for we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know. On theother hand, in our investigations of the phenomena of nature, much mustremain uncertain, and many questions continue insoluble; because whatwe know of nature is far from being sufficient to explain all thephenomena that are presented to our observation. Now the question is:Whether there is in transcendental philosophy any question, relating toan object presented to pure reason, which is unanswerable by thisreason; and whether we must regard the subject of the question as quiteuncertain, so far as our knowledge extends, and must give it a placeamong those subjects, of which we have just so much conception as issufficient to enable us to raise a question—faculty or materialsfailing us, however, when we attempt an answer.Now I maintain that, among all speculative cognition, the peculiarityof transcendental philosophy is that there is no question, relating toan object presented to pure reason, which is insoluble by this reason;and that the profession of unavoidable ignorance—the problem beingalleged to be beyond the reach of our faculties—cannot free us from theobligation to present a complete and satisfactory answer. For the veryconception which enables us to raise the question must give us thepower of answering it; inasmuch as the object, as in the case of rightand wrong, is not to be discovered out of the conception.But, in transcendental philosophy, it is only the cosmologicalquestions to which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation tothe constitution of their object; and the philosopher is not permittedto avail himself of the pretext of necessary ignorance and impenetrableobscurity. These questions relate solely to the cosmological ideas. Forthe object must be given in experience, and the question relates to theadequateness of the object to an idea. If the object is transcendentaland therefore itself unknown; if the question, for example, is whetherthe object—the something, the phenomenon of which (internal—inourselves) is thought—that is to say, the soul, is in itself a simplebeing; or whether there is a cause of all things, which is absolutelynecessary—in such cases we are seeking for our idea an object, of whichwe may confess that it is unknown to us, though we must not on thataccount assert that it is impossible.[58] The cosmological ideas aloneposses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them andthe empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object tobe given; and the question, which arises from these ideas, relatesmerely to the progress of this synthesis, in so far as it must containabsolute totality—which, however, is not empirical, as it cannot begiven in any experience. Now, as the question here is solely in regardto a thing as the object of a possible experience and not as a thing initself, the answer to the transcendental cosmological question need notbe sought out of the idea, for the question does not regard an objectin itself. The question in relation to a possible experience is not,“What can be given in an experience in concreto” but “what is containedin the idea, to which the empirical synthesis must approximate.” Thequestion must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone. Forthe idea is a creation of reason itself, which therefore cannotdisclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object. [58] The question, “What is the constitution of a transcendental object?” is unanswerable—we are unable to say what it is; but we can perceive that the question itself is nothing; because it does not relate to any object that can be presented to us. For this reason, we must consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as answerable and as really answered; for they relate to the transcendental subject of all internal phenomena, which is not itself phenomenon and consequently not given as an object, in which, moreover, none of the categories—and it is to them that the question is properly directed—find any conditions of its application. Here, therefore, is a case where no answer is the only proper answer. For a question regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be cogitated by any determined predicate, being completely beyond the sphere of objects and experience, is perfectly null and void.It is not so extraordinary, as it at first sight appears, that ascience should demand and expect satisfactory answers to all thequestions that may arise within its own sphere (questiones domesticae),although, up to a certain time, these answers may not have beendiscovered. There are, in addition to transcendental philosophy, onlytwo pure sciences of reason; the one with a speculative, the other witha practical content—pure mathematics and pure ethics. Has any one everheard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of theconditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of acircle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers? By theformer the sum cannot be given exactly, by the latter onlyapproximately; and therefore we decide that the impossibility of asolution of the question is evident. Lambert presented us with ademonstration of this. In the general principles of morals there can benothing uncertain, for the propositions are either utterly withoutmeaning, or must originate solely in our rational conceptions. On theother hand, there must be in physical science an infinite number ofconjectures, which can never become certainties; because the phenomenaof nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions. Thekey to the solution of such questions cannot, therefore, be found inour conceptions, or in pure thought, but must lie without us and forthat reason is in many cases not to be discovered; and consequently asatisfactory explanation cannot be expected. The questions oftranscendental analytic, which relate to the deduction of our purecognition, are not to be regarded as of the same kind as thosementioned above; for we are not at present treating of the certainty ofjudgements in relation to the origin of our conceptions, but only ofthat certainty in relation to objects.We cannot, therefore, escape the responsibility of at least a criticalsolution of the questions of reason, by complaints of the limitednature of our faculties, and the seemingly humble confession that it isbeyond the power of our reason to decide, whether the world has existedfrom all eternity or had a beginning—whether it is infinitely extended,or enclosed within certain limits—whether anything in the world issimple, or whether everything must be capable of infinitedivisibility—whether freedom can originate phenomena, or whethereverything is absolutely dependent on the laws and order of nature—and,finally, whether there exists a being that is completely unconditionedand necessary, or whether the existence of everything is conditionedand consequently dependent on something external to itself, andtherefore in its own nature contingent. For all these questions relateto an object, which can be given nowhere else than in thought. Thisobject is the absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis ofphenomena. If the conceptions in our minds do not assist us to somecertain result in regard to these problems, we must not defendourselves on the plea that the object itself remains hidden from andunknown to us. For no such thing or object can be given—it is not to befound out of the idea in our minds. We must seek the cause of ourfailure in our idea itself, which is an insoluble problem and in regardto which we obstinately assume that there exists a real objectcorresponding and adequate to it. A clear explanation of the dialecticwhich lies in our conception, will very soon enable us to come to asatisfactory decision in regard to such a question.The pretext that we are unable to arrive at certainty in regard tothese problems may be met with this question, which requires at least aplain answer: “From what source do the ideas originate, the solution ofwhich involves you in such difficulties? Are you seeking for anexplanation of certain phenomena; and do you expect these ideas to giveyou the principles or the rules of this explanation?” Let it begranted, that all nature was laid open before you; that nothing was hidfrom your senses and your consciousness. Still, you could not cognizein concreto the object of your ideas in any experience. For what isdemanded is not only this full and complete intuition, but also acomplete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality; andthis is not possible by means of any empirical cognition. It followsthat your question—your idea—is by no means necessary for theexplanation of any phenomenon; and the idea cannot have been in anysense given by the object itself. For such an object can never bepresented to us, because it cannot be given by any possible experience.Whatever perceptions you may attain to, you are still surrounded byconditions—in space, or in time—and you cannot discover anythingunconditioned; nor can you decide whether this unconditioned is to beplaced in an absolute beginning of the synthesis, or in an absolutetotality of the series without beginning. A whole, in the empiricalsignification of the term, is always merely comparative. The absolutewhole of quantity (the universe), of division, of derivation, of thecondition of existence, with the question—whether it is to be producedby finite or infinite synthesis, no possible experience can instruct usconcerning. You will not, for example, be able to explain the phenomenaof a body in the least degree better, whether you believe it to consistof simple, or of composite parts; for a simple phenomenon—and just aslittle an infinite series of composition—can never be presented to yourperception. Phenomena require and admit of explanation, only in so faras the conditions of that explanation are given in perception; but thesum total of that which is given in phenomena, considered as anabsolute whole, is itself a perception—and we cannot therefore seek forexplanations of this whole beyond itself, in other perceptions. Theexplanation of this whole is the proper object of the transcendentalproblems of pure reason.Although, therefore, the solution of these problems is unattainablethrough experience, we must not permit ourselves to say that it isuncertain how the object of our inquiries is constituted. For theobject is in our own mind and cannot be discovered in experience; andwe have only to take care that our thoughts are consistent with eachother, and to avoid falling into the amphiboly of regarding our idea asa representation of an object empirically given, and therefore to becognized according to the laws of experience. A dogmatical solution istherefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible. The criticalsolution, which may be a perfectly certain one, does not consider thequestion objectively, but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of thecognition upon which the question rests.Section V. Sceptical Exposition of the Cosmological Problems presentedin the four Transcendental IdeasWe should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmaticalanswer to our questions, if we understood beforehand that, be theanswer what it may, it would only serve to increase our ignorance, tothrow us from one incomprehensibility into another, from one obscurityinto another still greater, and perhaps lead us into irreconcilablecontradictions. If a dogmatical affirmative or negative answer isdemanded, is it at all prudent to set aside the probable grounds of asolution which lie before us and to take into consideration whatadvantage we shall gain, if the answer is to favour the one side or theother? If it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense, wehave in this an irresistible summons to institute a criticalinvestigation of the question, for the purpose of discovering whetherit is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea, thefalsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application andconsequences than in the mere representation of its content. This isthe great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questionsaddressed by pure reason to itself. By this method we easily ridourselves of the confusions of dogmatism, and establish in its place atemperate criticism, which, as a genuine cathartic, will successfullyremove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their consequence—thevain pretension to universal science.If, then, I could understand the nature of a cosmological idea andperceive, before I entered on the discussion of the subject at all,that, whatever side of the question regarding the unconditioned of theregressive synthesis of phenomena it favoured—it must either be toogreat or too small for every conception of the understanding—I would beable to comprehend how the idea, which relates to an object ofexperience—an experience which must be adequate to and in accordancewith a possible conception of the understanding—must be completely voidand without significance, inasmuch as its object is inadequate,consider it as we may. And this is actually the case with allcosmological conceptions, which, for the reason above mentioned,involve reason, so long as it remains attached to them, in anunavoidable antinomy. For suppose:First, that the world has no beginning—in this case it is too large forour conception; for this conception, which consists in a successiveregress, cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed. Grantthat it has a beginning, it is then too small for the conception of theunderstanding. For, as a beginning presupposes a time preceding, itcannot be unconditioned; and the law of the empirical employment of theunderstanding imposes the necessity of looking for a higher conditionof time; and the world is, therefore, evidently too small for this law.The same is the case with the double answer to the question regardingthe extent, in space, of the world. For, if it is infinite andunlimited, it must be too large for every possible empiricalconception. If it is finite and limited, we have a right to ask: “Whatdetermines these limits?” Void space is not a self-subsistent correlateof things, and cannot be a final condition—and still less an empiricalcondition, forming a part of a possible experience. For how can we haveany experience or perception of an absolute void? But the absolutetotality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned bean empirical conception. Consequently, a finite world is too small forour conception.Secondly, if every phenomenon (matter) in space consists of an infinitenumber of parts, the regress of the division is always too great forour conception; and if the division of space must cease with somemember of the division (the simple), it is too small for the idea ofthe unconditioned. For the member at which we have discontinued ourdivision still admits a regress to many more parts contained in theobject.Thirdly, suppose that every event in the world happens in accordancewith the laws of nature; the causality of a cause must itself be anevent and necessitates a regress to a still higher cause, andconsequently the unceasing prolongation of the series of conditions aparte priori. Operative nature is therefore too large for everyconception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events.If we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events, that is, offree agency, we are driven, in our search for sufficient reasons, on anunavoidable law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empiricallaw of causality, and we find that any such totality of connection inour synthesis is too small for our necessary empirical conception.Fourthly, if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessarybeing—whether it be the world or something in the world, or the causeof the world—we must place it in a time at an infinite distance fromany given moment; for, otherwise, it must be dependent on some otherand higher existence. Such an existence is, in this case, too large forour empirical conception, and unattainable by the continued regress ofany synthesis.But if we believe that everything in the world—be it condition orconditioned—is contingent; every given existence is too small for ourconception. For in this case we are compelled to seek for some otherexistence upon which the former depends.We have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is eithertoo great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis, andconsequently for every possible conception of the understanding. Whydid we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of thisand, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or offalling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in thefirst case, the empirical conception is always too small for the idea,and in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of thesecontradictions to the empirical regress? The reason is this. Possibleexperience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it aconception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object.Hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which weare to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fictionof thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world. If we sayof a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or toosmall, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter,and requiring to be adapted to it. Among the trivial subjects ofdiscussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question: “If aball cannot pass through a hole, shall we say that the ball is toolarge or the hole too small?” In this case it is indifferent whatexpression we employ; for we do not know which exists for the sake ofthe other. On the other hand, we cannot say: “The man is too long forhis coat”; but: “The coat is too short for the man.”We are thus led to the well-founded suspicion that the cosmologicalideas, and all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected withthem, are based upon a false and fictitious conception of the mode inwhich the object of these ideas is presented to us; and this suspicionwill probably direct us how to expose the illusion that has so long ledus astray from the truth.Section VI. Transcendental Idealism as the Key to the Solution of PureCosmological DialecticIn the transcendental æsthetic we proved that everything intuited inspace and time, all objects of a possible experience, are nothing butphenomena, that is, mere representations; and that these, as presentedto us—as extended bodies, or as series of changes—have noself-subsistent existence apart from human thought. This doctrine Icall Transcendental Idealism.[59] The realist in the transcendentalsense regards these modifications of our sensibility, these mererepresentations, as things subsisting in themselves. [59] I have elsewhere termed this theory formal idealism, to distinguish it from material idealism, which doubts or denies the existence of external things. To avoid ambiguity, it seems advisable in many cases to employ this term instead of that mentioned in the text.It would be unjust to accuse us of holding the long-decried theory ofempirical idealism, which, while admitting the reality of space,denies, or at least doubts, the existence of bodies extended in it, andthus leaves us without a sufficient criterion of reality and illusion.The supporters of this theory find no difficulty in admitting thereality of the phenomena of the internal sense in time; nay, they gothe length of maintaining that this internal experience is of itself asufficient proof of the real existence of its object as a thing initself.Transcendental idealism allows that the objects of externalintuition—as intuited in space, and all changes in time—as representedby the internal sense, are real. For, as space is the form of thatintuition which we call external, and, without objects in space, noempirical representation could be given us, we can and ought to regardextended bodies in it as real. The case is the same withrepresentations in time. But time and space, with all phenomenatherein, are not in themselves things. They are nothing butrepresentations and cannot exist out of and apart from the mind. Nay,the sensuous internal intuition of the mind (as the object ofconsciousness), the determination of which is represented by thesuccession of different states in time, is not the real, proper self,as it exists in itself—not the transcendental subject—but only aphenomenon, which is presented to the sensibility of this, to us,unknown being. This internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be aself-subsisting thing; for its condition is time, and time cannot bethe condition of a thing in itself. But the empirical truth ofphenomena in space and time is guaranteed beyond the possibility ofdoubt, and sufficiently distinguished from the illusion of dreams orfancy—although both have a proper and thorough connection in anexperience according to empirical laws. The objects of experience thenare not things in themselves, but are given only in experience, andhave no existence apart from and independently of experience. Thatthere may be inhabitants in the moon, although no one has ever observedthem, must certainly be admitted; but this assertion means only, thatwe may in the possible progress of experience discover them at somefuture time. For that which stands in connection with a perceptionaccording to the laws of the progress of experience is real. They aretherefore really existent, if they stand in empirical connection withmy actual or real consciousness, although they are not in themselvesreal, that is, apart from the progress of experience.There is nothing actually given—we can be conscious of nothing as real,except a perception and the empirical progression from it to otherpossible perceptions. For phenomena, as mere representations, are realonly in perception; and perception is, in fact, nothing but the realityof an empirical representation, that is, a phenomenon. To call aphenomenon a real thing prior to perception means either that we mustmeet with this phenomenon in the progress of experience, or it meansnothing at all. For I can say only of a thing in itself that it existswithout relation to the senses and experience. But we are speaking heremerely of phenomena in space and time, both of which are determinationsof sensibility, and not of things in themselves. It follows thatphenomena are not things in themselves, but are mere representations,which if not given in us—in perception—are non-existent.The faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivity—a capacityof being affected in a certain manner by representations, the relationof which to each other is a pure intuition of space and time—the pureforms of sensibility. These representations, in so far as they areconnected and determinable in this relation (in space and time)according to laws of the unity of experience, are called objects. Thenon-sensuous cause of these representations is completely unknown to usand hence cannot be intuited as an object. For such an object could notbe represented either in space or in time; and without these conditionsintuition or representation is impossible. We may, at the same time,term the non-sensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental object—butmerely as a mental correlate to sensibility, considered as areceptivity. To this transcendental object we may attribute the wholeconnection and extent of our possible perceptions, and say that it isgiven and exists in itself prior to all experience. But the phenomena,corresponding to it, are not given as things in themselves, but inexperience alone. For they are mere representations, receiving fromperceptions alone significance and relation to a real object, under thecondition that this or that perception—indicating an object—is incomplete connection with all others in accordance with the rules of theunity of experience. Thus we can say: “The things that really existedin past time are given in the transcendental object of experience.” Butthese are to me real objects, only in so far as I can represent to myown mind, that a regressive series of possible perceptions—followingthe indications of history, or the footsteps of cause and effect—inaccordance with empirical laws—that, in one word, the course of theworld conducts us to an elapsed series of time as the condition of thepresent time. This series in past time is represented as real, not initself, but only in connection with a possible experience. Thus, when Isay that certain events occurred in past time, I merely assert thepossibility of prolonging the chain of experience, from the presentperception, upwards to the conditions that determine it according totime.If I represent to myself all objects existing in all space and time, Ido not thereby place these in space and time prior to all experience;on the contrary, such a representation is nothing more than the notionof a possible experience, in its absolute completeness. In experiencealone are those objects, which are nothing but representations, given.But, when I say they existed prior to my experience, this means onlythat I must begin with the perception present to me and follow thetrack indicated until I discover them in some part or region ofexperience. The cause of the empirical condition of thisprogression—and consequently at what member therein I must stop, and atwhat point in the regress I am to find this member—is transcendental,and hence necessarily incognizable. But with this we have not to do;our concern is only with the law of progression in experience, in whichobjects, that is, phenomena, are given. It is a matter of indifference,whether I say, “I may in the progress of experience discover stars, ata hundred times greater distance than the most distant of those nowvisible,” or, “Stars at this distance may be met in space, although noone has, or ever will discover them.” For, if they are given as thingsin themselves, without any relation to possible experience, they arefor me non-existent, consequently, are not objects, for they are notcontained in the regressive series of experience. But, if thesephenomena must be employed in the construction or support of thecosmological idea of an absolute whole, and when we are discussing aquestion that oversteps the limits of possible experience, the properdistinction of the different theories of the reality of sensuousobjects is of great importance, in order to avoid the illusion whichmust necessarily arise from the misinterpretation of our empiricalconceptions.Section VII. Critical Solution of the Cosmological ProblemThe antinomy of pure reason is based upon the following dialecticalargument: “If that which is conditioned is given, the whole series ofits conditions is also given; but sensuous objects are given asconditioned; consequently...” This syllogism, the major of which seemsso natural and evident, introduces as many cosmological ideas as thereare different kinds of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena, in sofar as these conditions constitute a series. These ideas requireabsolute totality in the series, and thus place reason in inextricableembarrassment. Before proceeding to expose the fallacy in thisdialectical argument, it will be necessary to have a correctunderstanding of certain conceptions that appear in it.In the first place, the following proposition is evident, andindubitably certain: “If the conditioned is given, a regress in theseries of all its conditions is thereby imperatively required.” For thevery conception of a conditioned is a conception of something relatedto a condition, and, if this condition is itself conditioned, toanother condition—and so on through all the members of the series. Thisproposition is, therefore, analytical and has nothing to fear fromtranscendental criticism. It is a logical postulate of reason: topursue, as far as possible, the connection of a conception with itsconditions.If, in the second place, both the conditioned and the condition arethings in themselves, and if the former is given, not only is theregress to the latter requisite, but the latter is really given withthe former. Now, as this is true of all the members of the series, theentire series of conditions, and with them the unconditioned, is at thesame time given in the very fact of the conditioned, the existence ofwhich is possible only in and through that series, being given. In thiscase, the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition, is asynthesis of the understanding merely, which represents things as theyare, without regarding whether and how we can cognize them. But if Ihave to do with phenomena, which, in their character of mererepresentations, are not given, if I do not attain to a cognition ofthem (in other words, to themselves, for they are nothing more thanempirical cognitions), I am not entitled to say: “If the conditioned isgiven, all its conditions (as phenomena) are also given.” I cannot,therefore, from the fact of a conditioned being given, infer theabsolute totality of the series of its conditions. For phenomena arenothing but an empirical synthesis in apprehension or perception, andare therefore given only in it. Now, in speaking of phenomena it doesnot follow that, if the conditioned is given, the synthesis whichconstitutes its empirical condition is also thereby given andpresupposed; such a synthesis can be established only by an actualregress in the series of conditions. But we are entitled to say in thiscase that a regress to the conditions of a conditioned, in other words,that a continuous empirical synthesis is enjoined; that, if theconditions are not given, they are at least required; and that we arecertain to discover the conditions in this regress.We can now see that the major, in the above cosmological syllogism,takes the conditioned in the transcendental signification which it hasin the pure category, while the minor speaks of it in the empiricalsignification which it has in the category as applied to phenomena.There is, therefore, a dialectical fallacy in the syllogism—a sophismafigurae dictionis. But this fallacy is not a consciously devised one,but a perfectly natural illusion of the common reason of man. For, whena thing is given as conditioned, we presuppose in the major itsconditions and their series, unperceived, as it were, and unseen;because this is nothing more than the logical requirement of completeand satisfactory premisses for a given conclusion. In this case, timeis altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with thecondition; they are supposed to be given in themselves, andcontemporaneously. It is, moreover, just as natural to regard phenomena(in the minor) as things in themselves and as objects presented to thepure understanding, as in the major, in which complete abstraction wasmade of all conditions of intuition. But it is under these conditionsalone that objects are given. Now we overlooked a remarkabledistinction between the conceptions. The synthesis of the conditionedwith its condition, and the complete series of the latter (in themajor) are not limited by time, and do not contain the conception ofsuccession. On the contrary, the empirical synthesis and the series ofconditions in the phenomenal world—subsumed in the minor—arenecessarily successive and given in time alone. It follows that Icannot presuppose in the minor, as I did in the major, the absolutetotality of the synthesis and of the series therein represented; for inthe major all the members of the series are given as things inthemselves—without any limitations or conditions of time, while in theminor they are possible only in and through a successive regress, whichcannot exist, except it be actually carried into execution in the worldof phenomena.After this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employedin maintaining cosmological assertions, both parties may now be justlydismissed, as advancing claims without grounds or title. But theprocess has not been ended by convincing them that one or both were inthe wrong and had maintained an assertion which was without validgrounds of proof. Nothing seems to be clearer than that, if onemaintains: “The world has a beginning,” and another: “The world has nobeginning,” one of the two must be right. But it is likewise clearthat, if the evidence on both sides is equal, it is impossible todiscover on what side the truth lies; and the controversy continues,although the parties have been recommended to peace before the tribunalof reason. There remains, then, no other means of settling the questionthan to convince the parties, who refute each other with suchconclusiveness and ability, that they are disputing about nothing, andthat a transcendental illusion has been mocking them with visions ofreality where there is none. The mode of adjusting a dispute whichcannot be decided upon its own merits, we shall now proceed to laybefore our readers.Zeno of Elea, a subtle dialectician, was severely reprimanded by Platoas a sophist, who, merely from the base motive of exhibiting his skillin discussion, maintained and subverted the same proposition byarguments as powerful and convincing on the one side as on the other.He maintained, for example, that God (who was probably nothing more, inhis view, than the world) is neither finite nor infinite, neither inmotion nor in rest, neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing.It seemed to those philosophers who criticized his mode of discussionthat his purpose was to deny completely both of two self-contradictorypropositions—which is absurd. But I cannot believe that there is anyjustice in this accusation. The first of these propositions I shallpresently consider in a more detailed manner. With regard to theothers, if by the word of God he understood merely the Universe, hismeaning must have been—that it cannot be permanently present in oneplace—that is, at rest—nor be capable of changing its place—that is, ofmoving—because all places are in the universe, and the universe itselfis, therefore, in no place. Again, if the universe contains in itselfeverything that exists, it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any otherthing, because there is, in fact, no other thing with which it can becompared. If two opposite judgements presuppose a contingentimpossible, or arbitrary condition, both—in spite of their opposition(which is, however, not properly or really a contradiction)—fall away;because the condition, which ensured the validity of both, has itselfdisappeared.If we say: “Everybody has either a good or a bad smell,” we haveomitted a third possible judgement—it has no smell at all; and thusboth conflicting statements may be false. If we say: “It is eithergood-smelling or not good-smelling (vel suaveolens velnon-suaveolens),” both judgements are contradictorily opposed; and thecontradictory opposite of the former judgement—some bodies are notgood-smelling—embraces also those bodies which have no smell at all. Inthe preceding pair of opposed judgements (per disparata), thecontingent condition of the conception of body (smell) attached to bothconflicting statements, instead of having been omitted in the latter,which is consequently not the contradictory opposite of the former.If, accordingly, we say: “The world is either infinite in extension, orit is not infinite (non est infinitus)”; and if the former propositionis false, its contradictory opposite—the world is not infinite—must betrue. And thus I should deny the existence of an infinite, without,however affirming the existence of a finite world. But if we constructour proposition thus: “The world is either infinite or finite(non-infinite),” both statements may be false. For, in this case, weconsider the world as per se determined in regard to quantity, andwhile, in the one judgement, we deny its infinite and consequently,perhaps, its independent existence; in the other, we append to theworld, regarded as a thing in itself, a certain determination—that offinitude; and the latter may be false as well as the former, if theworld is not given as a thing in itself, and thus neither as finite noras infinite in quantity. This kind of opposition I may be allowed toterm dialectical; that of contradictories may be called analyticalopposition. Thus then, of two dialectically opposed judgements both maybe false, from the fact, that the one is not a mere contradictory ofthe other, but actually enounces more than is requisite for a full andcomplete contradiction.When we regard the two propositions—“The world is infinite inquantity,” and, “The world is finite in quantity,” as contradictoryopposites, we are assuming that the world—the complete series ofphenomena—is a thing in itself. For it remains as a permanent quantity,whether I deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of itsphenomena. But if we dismiss this assumption—this transcendentalillusion—and deny that it is a thing in itself, the contradictoryopposition is metamorphosed into a merely dialectical one; and theworld, as not existing in itself—independently of the regressive seriesof my representations—exists in like manner neither as a whole which isinfinite nor as a whole which is finite in itself. The universe existsfor me only in the empirical regress of the series of phenomena and notper se. If, then, it is always conditioned, it is never completely oras a whole; and it is, therefore, not an unconditioned whole and doesnot exist as such, either with an infinite, or with a finite quantity.What we have here said of the first cosmological idea—that of theabsolute totality of quantity in phenomena—applies also to the others.The series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressivesynthesis itself, and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing initself—given prior to all regress. Hence I am compelled to say: “Theaggregate of parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finitenor infinite; and these parts are given only in the regressivesynthesis of decomposition—a synthesis which is never given in absolutecompleteness, either as finite, or as infinite.” The same is the casewith the series of subordinated causes, or of the conditioned up to theunconditioned and necessary existence, which can never be regarded asin itself, and in its totality, either as finite or as infinite;because, as a series of subordinate representations, it subsists onlyin the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previouslyto this regress, or as a self-subsistent series of things.Thus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears.For the above demonstration has established the fact that it is merelythe product of a dialectical and illusory opposition, which arises fromthe application of the idea of absolute totality—admissible only as acondition of things in themselves—to phenomena, which exist only in ourrepresentations, and—when constituting a series—in a successiveregress. This antinomy of reason may, however, be really profitable toour speculative interests, not in the way of contributing anydogmatical addition, but as presenting to us another material supportin our critical investigations. For it furnishes us with an indirectproof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena, if our minds werenot completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in theTrancendental Æsthetic. The proof would proceed in the followingdilemma. If the world is a whole existing in itself, it must be eitherfinite or infinite. But it is neither finite nor infinite—as has beenshown, on the one side, by the thesis, on the other, by the antithesis.Therefore the world—the content of all phenomena—is not a wholeexisting in itself. It follows that phenomena are nothing, apart fromour representations. And this is what we mean by transcendentalideality.This remark is of some importance. It enables us to see that the proofsof the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistries—are not fallacious,but grounded on the nature of reason, and valid—under the suppositionthat phenomena are things in themselves. The opposition of thejudgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in theinitial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the trueconstitution of objects of sense. This transcendental dialectic doesnot favour scepticism, although it presents us with a triumphantdemonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method, the greatutility of which is apparent in the antinomy, where the arguments ofreason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force. Andalthough the result of these conflicts of reason is not what weexpected—although we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition tometaphysical science—we have still reaped a great advantage in thecorrection of our judgements on these subjects of thought.Section VIII. Regulative Principle of Pure Reason in relation to theCosmological IdeasThe cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certainknowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in theworld of sense, considered as a thing in itself. The actual regress inthe series is the only means of approaching this maximum. Thisprinciple of pure reason, therefore, may still be considered asvalid—not as an axiom enabling us to cogitate totality in the object asactual, but as a problem for the understanding, which requires it toinstitute and to continue, in conformity with the idea of totality inthe mind, the regress in the series of the conditions of a givenconditioned. For in the world of sense, that is, in space and time,every condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena isitself conditioned; because sensuous objects are not things inthemselves (in which case an absolutely unconditioned might be reachedin the progress of cognition), but are merely empirical representationsthe conditions of which must always be found in intuition. Theprinciple of reason is therefore properly a mere rule—prescribing aregress in the series of conditions for given phenomena, andprohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely unconditioned. It is,therefore, not a principle of the possibility of experience or of theempirical cognition of sensuous objects—consequently not a principle ofthe understanding; for every experience is confined within certainproper limits determined by the given intuition. Still less is it aconstitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend ourconception of the sensuous world beyond all possible experience. It ismerely a principle for the enlargement and extension of experience asfar as is possible for human faculties. It forbids us to consider anyempirical limits as absolute. It is, hence, a principle of reason,which, as a rule, dictates how we ought to proceed in our empiricalregress, but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior to the empiricalregress what is given in the object itself. I have termed it for thisreason a regulative principle of reason; while the principle of theabsolute totality of the series of conditions, as existing in itselfand given in the object, is a constitutive cosmological principle. Thisdistinction will at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutiveprinciple, and prevent us from attributing (by a transcendentalsubreptio) objective reality to an idea, which is valid only as a rule.In order to understand the proper meaning of this rule of pure reason,we must notice first that it cannot tell us what the object is, butonly how the empirical regress is to be proceeded with in order toattain to the complete conception of the object. If it gave us anyinformation in respect to the former statement, it would be aconstitutive principle—a principle impossible from the nature of purereason. It will not therefore enable us to establish any suchconclusions as: “The series of conditions for a given conditioned is initself finite,” or, “It is infinite.” For, in this case, we should becogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality, an object which isnot and cannot be given in experience; inasmuch as we should beattributing a reality objective and independent of the empiricalsynthesis, to a series of phenomena. This idea of reason cannot then beregarded as valid—except as a rule for the regressive synthesis in theseries of conditions, according to which we must proceed from theconditioned, through all intermediate and subordinate conditions, up tothe unconditioned; although this goal is unattained and unattainable.For the absolutely unconditioned cannot be discovered in the sphere ofexperience.We now proceed to determine clearly our notion of a synthesis which cannever be complete. There are two terms commonly employed for thispurpose. These terms are regarded as expressions of different anddistinguishable notions, although the ground of the distinction hasnever been clearly exposed. The term employed by the mathematicians isprogressus in infinitum. The philosophers prefer the expressionprogressus in indefinitum. Without detaining the reader with anexamination of the reasons for such a distinction, or with remarks onthe right or wrong use of the terms, I shall endeavour clearly todetermine these conceptions, so far as is necessary for the purpose inthis Critique.We may, with propriety, say of a straight line, that it may be producedto infinity. In this case the distinction between a progressus ininfinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety.For, although when we say, “Produce a straight line,” it is morecorrect to say in indefinitum than in infinitum; because the formermeans, “Produce it as far as you please,” the second, “You must notcease to produce it”; the expression in infinitum is, when we arespeaking of the power to do it, perfectly correct, for we can alwaysmake it longer if we please—on to infinity. And this remark holds goodin all cases, when we speak of a progressus, that is, an advancementfrom the condition to the conditioned; this possible advancement alwaysproceeds to infinity. We may proceed from a given pair in thedescending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate anever-ending line of descendants from it. For in such a case reasondoes not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does notpresuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely asconditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile).Very different is the case with the problem: “How far the regress,which ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions, mustextend”; whether I can say: “It is a regress in infinitum,” or only “inindefinitum”; and whether, for example, setting out from the humanbeings at present alive in the world, I may ascend in the series oftheir ancestors, in infinitum—or whether all that can be said is, thatso far as I have proceeded, I have discovered no empirical ground forconsidering the series limited, so that I am justified, and indeed,compelled to search for ancestors still further back, although I am notobliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them.My answer to this question is: “If the series is given in empiricalintuition as a whole, the regress in the series of its internalconditions proceeds in infinitum; but, if only one member of the seriesis given, from which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality,the regress is possible only in indefinitum.” For example, the divisionof a portion of matter given within certain limits—of a body, thatis—proceeds in infinitum. For, as the condition of this whole is itspart, and the condition of the part a part of the part, and so on, andas in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned indivisible memberof the series of conditions is not to be found; there are no reasons orgrounds in experience for stopping in the division, but, on thecontrary, the more remote members of the division are actually andempirically given prior to this division. That is to say, the divisionproceeds to infinity. On the other hand, the series of ancestors of anygiven human being is not given, in its absolute totality, in anyexperience, and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical memberof this series to one still higher, and does not meet with anyempirical limit presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of theseries. But as the members of such a series are not contained in theempirical intuition of the whole, prior to the regress, this regressdoes not proceed to infinity, but only in indefinitum, that is, we arecalled upon to discover other and higher members, which are themselvesalways conditioned.In neither case—the regressus in infinitum, nor the regressus inindefinitum, is the series of conditions to be considered as actuallyinfinite in the object itself. This might be true of things inthemselves, but it cannot be asserted of phenomena, which, asconditions of each other, are only given in the empirical regressitself. Hence, the question no longer is, “What is the quantity of thisseries of conditions in itself—is it finite or infinite?” for it isnothing in itself; but, “How is the empirical regress to be commenced,and how far ought we to proceed with it?” And here a signal distinctionin the application of this rule becomes apparent. If the whole is givenempirically, it is possible to recede in the series of its internalconditions to infinity. But if the whole is not given, and can only begiven by and through the empirical regress, I can only say: “It ispossible to infinity, to proceed to still higher conditions in theseries.” In the first case, I am justified in asserting that moremembers are empirically given in the object than I attain to in theregress (of decomposition). In the second case, I am justified only insaying, that I can always proceed further in the regress, because nomember of the series is given as absolutely conditioned, and thus ahigher member is possible, and an inquiry with regard to it isnecessary. In the one case it is necessary to find other members of theseries, in the other it is necessary to inquire for others, inasmuch asexperience presents no absolute limitation of the regress. For, eitheryou do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empiricalregress, and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete;or, you do possess such a limitative perception, in which case it isnot a part of your series (for that which limits must be distinct fromthat which is limited by it), and it is incumbent you to continue yourregress up to this condition, and so on.These remarks will be placed in their proper light by their applicationin the following section.Section IX. Of the Empirical Use of the Regulative Principle of Reasonwith regard to the Cosmological IdeasWe have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of theconceptions of reason or of understanding. We have shown, likewise,that the demand of absolute totality in the series of conditions in theworld of sense arises from a transcendental employment of reason,resting on the opinion that phenomena are to be regarded as things inthemselves. It follows that we are not required to answer the questionrespecting the absolute quantity of a series—whether it is in itselflimited or unlimited. We are only called upon to determine how far wemust proceed in the empirical regress from condition to condition, inorder to discover, in conformity with the rule of reason, a full andcorrect answer to the questions proposed by reason itself.This principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for theextension of a possible experience—its invalidity as a principleconstitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficientlydemonstrated. And thus, too, the antinomial conflict of reason withitself is completely put an end to; inasmuch as we have not onlypresented a critical solution of the fallacy lurking in the oppositestatements of reason, but have shown the true meaning of the ideaswhich gave rise to these statements. The dialectical principle ofreason has, therefore, been changed into a doctrinal principle. But infact, if this principle, in the subjective signification which we haveshown to be its only true sense, may be guaranteed as a principle ofthe unceasing extension of the employment of our understanding, itsinfluence and value are just as great as if it were an axiom for the àpriori determination of objects. For such an axiom could not exert astronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge,otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding themost widely expanded employment in the field of experience.I. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Compositionof Phenomena in the UniverseHere, as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems, theground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that inour empirical regress no experience of an absolute limit, andconsequently no experience of a condition, which is itself absolutelyunconditioned, is discoverable. And the truth of this propositionitself rests upon the consideration that such an experience mustrepresent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere void, onwhich our continued regress by means of perception must abut—which isimpossible.Now this proposition, which declares that every condition attained inthe empirical regress must itself be considered empiricallyconditioned, contains the rule in terminis, which requires me, towhatever extent I may have proceeded in the ascending series, always tolook for some higher member in the series—whether this member is tobecome known to me through experience, or not.Nothing further is necessary, then, for the solution of the firstcosmological problem, than to decide, whether, in the regress to theunconditioned quantity of the universe (as regards space and time),this never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitumor indefinitum.The general representation which we form in our minds of the series ofall past states or conditions of the world, or of all the things whichat present exist in it, is itself nothing more than a possibleempirical regress, which is cogitated—although in an undeterminedmanner—in the mind, and which gives rise to the conception of a seriesof conditions for a given object.[60] Now I have a conception of theuniverse, but not an intuition—that is, not an intuition of it as awhole. Thus I cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from thequantity or magnitude of the world, and determine the former by meansof the latter; on the contrary, I must first of all form a conceptionof the quantity or magnitude of the world from the magnitude of theempirical regress. But of this regress I know nothing more than that Iought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions toone still higher. But the quantity of the universe is not therebydetermined, and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds ininfinitum. Such an affirmation would anticipate the members of theseries which have not yet been reached, and represent the number ofthem as beyond the grasp of any empirical synthesis; it wouldconsequently determine the cosmical quantity prior to the regress(although only in a negative manner)—which is impossible. For the worldis not given in its totality in any intuition: consequently, itsquantity cannot be given prior to the regress. It follows that we areunable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity initself—not even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum; wemust only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of theuniverse, in conformity with the rule which determines the empiricalregress in it. But this rule merely requires us never to admit anabsolute limit to our series—how far soever we may have proceeded init, but always, on the contrary, to subordinate every phenomenon tosome other as its condition, and consequently to proceed to this higherphenomenon. Such a regress is, therefore, the regressus in indefinitum,which, as not determining a quantity in the object, is clearlydistinguishable from the regressus in infinitum. [60] The cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the possible empirical regress, upon which its conception is based. And as this regress cannot be a determinate infinite regress, still less a determinate finite (absolutely limited), it is evident that we cannot regard the world as either finite or infinite, because the regress, which gives us the representation of the world, is neither finite nor infinite.It follows from what we have said that we are not justified indeclaring the world to be infinite in space, or as regards past time.For this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but wecannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as anobject of the senses. I cannot say, “The regress from a givenperception to everything limited either in space or time, proceeds ininfinitum,” for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity; neithercan I say, “It is finite,” for an absolute limit is likewise impossiblein experience. It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertionat all respecting the whole object of experience—the world of sense; Imust limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience orempirical knowledge is to be attained.To the question, therefore, respecting the cosmical quantity, the firstand negative answer is: “The world has no beginning in time, and noabsolute limit in space.”For, in the contrary case, it would be limited by a void time on theone hand, and by a void space on the other. Now, since the world, as aphenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not athing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception ofthis limitation by a void time and a void space. But such aperception—such an experience is impossible; because it has no content.Consequently, an absolute cosmical limit is empirically, and thereforeabsolutely, impossible.[61] [61] The reader will remark that the proof presented above is very different from the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of the first antinomy. In that demonstration, it was taken for granted that the world is a thing in itself—given in its totality prior to all regress, and a determined position in space and time was denied to it—if it was not considered as occupying all time and all space. Hence our conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the antithesis the actual infinity of the world.From this follows the affirmative answer: “The regress in the series ofphenomena—as a determination of the cosmical quantity, proceeds inindefinitum.” This is equivalent to saying: “The world of sense has noabsolute quantity, but the empirical regress (through which alone theworld of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions) restsupon a rule, which requires it to proceed from every member of theseries, as conditioned, to one still more remote (whether throughpersonal experience, or by means of history, or the chain of cause andeffect), and not to cease at any point in this extension of thepossible empirical employment of the understanding.” And this is theproper and only use which reason can make of its principles.The above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind ofphenomena. It does not, for example, forbid us, in our ascent from anindividual human being through the line of his ancestors, to expectthat we shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair, orto admit, in the series of heavenly bodies, a sun at the farthestpossible distance from some centre. All that it demands is a perpetualprogress from phenomena to phenomena, even although an actualperception is not presented by them (as in the case of our perceptionsbeing so weak as that we are unable to become conscious of them), sincethey, nevertheless, belong to possible experience.Every beginning is in time, and all limits to extension are in space.But space and time are in the world of sense. Consequently phenomena inthe world are conditionally limited, but the world itself is notlimited, either conditionally or unconditionally.For this reason, and because neither the world nor the cosmical seriesof conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given, ourconception of the cosmical quantity is given only in and through theregress and not prior to it—in a collective intuition. But the regressitself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmicalquantity, and cannot therefore give us any determined conception ofit—still less a conception of a quantity which is, in relation to acertain standard, infinite. The regress does not, therefore, proceed toinfinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for orthe of presenting to us a quantity—realized only in and through theregress itself.II. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Divisionof a Whole given in IntuitionWhen I divide a whole which is given in intuition, I proceed from aconditioned to its conditions. The division of the parts of the whole(subdivisio or decompositio) is a regress in the series of theseconditions. The absolute totality of this series would be actuallyattained and given to the mind, if the regress could arrive at simpleparts. But if all the parts in a continuous decomposition arethemselves divisible, the division, that is to say, the regress,proceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum; becausethe conditions (the parts) are themselves contained in the conditioned,and, as the latter is given in a limited intuition, the former are allgiven along with it. This regress cannot, therefore, be called aregressus in indefinitum, as happened in the case of the precedingcosmological idea, the regress in which proceeded from the conditionedto the conditions not given contemporaneously and along with it, butdiscoverable only through the empirical regress. We are not, however,entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind, which is divisible ininfinitum, that it consists of an infinite number of parts. For,although all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, thewhole division is not contained therein. The division is contained onlyin the progressing decomposition—in the regress itself, which is thecondition of the possibility and actuality of the series. Now, as thisregress is infinite, all the members (parts) to which it attains mustbe contained in the given whole as an aggregate. But the completeseries of division is not contained therein. For this series, beinginfinite in succession and always incomplete, cannot represent aninfinite number of members, and still less a composition of thesemembers into a whole.To apply this remark to space. Every limited part of space presented tointuition is a whole, the parts of which are always spaces—to whateverextent subdivided. Every limited space is hence divisible to infinity.Let us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed inlimits, that is, a body. The divisibility of a body rests upon thedivisibility of space, which is the condition of the possibility of thebody as an extended whole. A body is consequently divisible toinfinity, though it does not, for that reason, consist of an infinitenumber of parts.It certainly seems that, as a body must be cogitated as substance inspace, the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it assubstance. For we may and ought to grant, in the case of space, thatdivision or decomposition, to any extent, never can utterly annihilatecomposition (that is to say, the smallest part of space must stillconsist of spaces); otherwise space would entirely cease to exist—whichis impossible. But, the assertion on the other hand that when allcomposition in matter is annihilated in thought, nothing remains, doesnot seem to harmonize with the conception of substance, which must beproperly the subject of all composition and must remain, even after theconjunction of its attributes in space—which constituted a body—isannihilated in thought. But this is not the case with substance in thephenomenal world, which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the purecategory. Phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject; it is merelya permanent sensuous image, and nothing more than an intuition, inwhich the unconditioned is not to be found.But, although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate andapplicable to the subdivision of a phenomenon, as a mere occupation orfilling of space, it is not applicable to a whole consisting of anumber of distinct parts and constituting a quantum discretum—that isto say, an organized body. It cannot be admitted that every part in anorganized whole is itself organized, and that, in analysing it toinfinity, we must always meet with organized parts; although we mayallow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in infinitum, maybe organized. For the infinity of the division of a phenomenon in spacerests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon isgiven only in and through this infinity, that is, an undeterminednumber of parts is given, while the parts themselves are given anddetermined only in and through the subdivision; in a word, the infinityof the division necessarily presupposes that the whole is not alreadydivided in se. Hence our division determines a number of parts in thewhole—a number which extends just as far as the actual regress in thedivision; while, on the other hand, the very notion of a body organizedto infinity represents the whole as already and in itself divided. Weexpect, therefore, to find in it a determinate, but at the same time,infinite, number of parts—which is self-contradictory. For we shouldthus have a whole containing a series of members which could not becompleted in any regress—which is infinite, and at the same timecomplete in an organized composite. Infinite divisibility is applicableonly to a quantum continuum, and is based entirely on the infinitedivisibility of space, But in a quantum discretum the multitude ofparts or units is always determined, and hence always equal to somenumber. To what extent a body may be organized, experience alone caninform us; and although, so far as our experience of this or that bodyhas extended, we may not have discovered any inorganic part, such partsmust exist in possible experience. But how far the transcendentaldivision of a phenomenon must extend, we cannot know from experience—itis a question which experience cannot answer; it is answered only bythe principle of reason which forbids us to consider the empiricalregress, in the analysis of extended body, as ever absolutely complete.Concluding Remark on the Solution of the Transcendental MathematicalIdeas—and Introductory to the Solution of the Dynamical Ideas.We presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form, and weendeavoured to show the ground of this self-contradiction on the partof reason, and the only means of bringing it to a conclusion—namely, bydeclaring both contradictory statements to be false. We represented inthese antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to theconditioned according to relations of space and time—which is the usualsupposition of the common understanding. In this respect, alldialectical representations of totality, in the series of conditions toa given conditioned, were perfectly homogeneous. The condition wasalways a member of the series along with the conditioned, and thus thehomogeneity of the whole series was assured. In this case the regresscould never be cogitated as complete; or, if this was the case, amember really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member,consequently as unconditioned. In such an antinomy, therefore, we didnot consider the object, that is, the conditioned, but the series ofconditions belonging to the object, and the magnitude of that series.And thus arose the difficulty—a difficulty not to be settled by anydecision regarding the claims of the two parties, but simply by cuttingthe knot—by declaring the series proposed by reason to be either toolong or too short for the understanding, which could in neither casemake its conceptions adequate with the ideas.But we have overlooked, up to this point, an essential differenceexisting between the conceptions of the understanding which reasonendeavours to raise to the rank of ideas—two of these indicating amathematical, and two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena. Hitherto, itwas necessary to signalize this distinction; for, just as in ourgeneral representation of all transcendental ideas, we considered themunder phenomenal conditions, so, in the two mathematical ideas, ourdiscussion is concerned solely with an object in the world ofphenomena. But as we are now about to proceed to the consideration ofthe dynamical conceptions of the understanding, and their adequatenesswith ideas, we must not lose sight of this distinction. We shall findthat it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in whichreason is involved. For, while in the first two antinomies, bothparties were dismissed, on the ground of having advanced statementsbased upon false hypothesis; in the present case the hope appears ofdiscovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the demands ofreason, and, the judge completing the statement of the grounds ofclaim, which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state, thequestion may be settled on its own merits, not by dismissing theclaimants, but by a comparison of the arguments on both sides. If weconsider merely their extension, and whether they are adequate withideas, the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous. Butthe conception of the understanding which lies at the basis of theseideas, contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous (presupposed inevery quantity—in its composition as well as in its division) or of theheterogeneous, which is the case in the dynamical synthesis of causeand effect, as well as of the necessary and the contingent.Thus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no otherthan a sensuous condition is admissible—a condition which is itself amember of the series; while the dynamical series of sensuous conditionsadmits a heterogeneous condition, which is not a member of the series,but, as purely intelligible, lies out of and beyond it. And thus reasonis satisfied, and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series ofphenomena, without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it,contrary to the principles of the understanding.Now, from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition ofphenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena, arisesa result which we should not have expected from an antinomy. In formercases, the result was that both contradictory dialectical statementswere declared to be false. In the present case, we find the conditionedin the dynamical series connected with an empirically unconditioned,but non-sensuous condition; and thus satisfaction is done to theunderstanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other.[62]While, moreover, the dialectical arguments for unconditioned totalityin mere phenomena fall to the ground, both propositions of reason maybe shown to be true in their proper signification. This could nothappen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded amathematically unconditioned unity; for no condition could be placed atthe head of the series of phenomena, except one which was itself aphenomenon and consequently a member of the series. [62] For the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition which is itself empirically unconditioned. But if it is possible to cogitate an intelligible condition—one which is not a member of the series of phenomena—for a conditioned phenomenon, without breaking the series of empirical conditions, such a condition may be admissible as empirically unconditioned, and the empirical regress continue regular, unceasing, and intact.III. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Deductionof Cosmical Events from their CausesThere are only two modes of causality cogitable—the causality of natureor of freedom. The first is the conjunction of a particular state withanother preceding it in the world of sense, the former following thelatter by virtue of a law. Now, as the causality of phenomena issubject to conditions of time, and the preceding state, if it hadalways existed, could not have produced an effect which would make itsfirst appearance at a particular time, the causality of a cause mustitself be an effect—must itself have begun to be, and therefore,according to the principle of the understanding, itself requires acause.We must understand, on the contrary, by the term freedom, in thecosmological sense, a faculty of the spontaneous origination of astate; the causality of which, therefore, is not subordinated toanother cause determining it in time. Freedom is in this sense a puretranscendental idea, which, in the first place, contains no empiricalelement; the object of which, in the second place, cannot be given ordetermined in any experience, because it is a universal law of the verypossibility of experience, that everything which happens must have acause, that consequently the causality of a cause, being itselfsomething that has happened, must also have a cause. In this view ofthe case, the whole field of experience, how far soever it may extend,contains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature. But, as wecannot by this means attain to an absolute totality of conditions inreference to the series of causes and effects, reason creates the ideaof a spontaneity, which can begin to act of itself, and without anyexternal cause determining it to action, according to the natural lawof causality.It is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom isbased upon the transcendental idea, and that the question of thepossibility of the former is difficult only as it involves theconsideration of the truth of the latter. Freedom, in the practicalsense, is the independence of the will of coercion by sensuousimpulses. A will is sensuous, in so far as it is pathologicallyaffected (by sensuous impulses); it is termed animal (arbitriumbrutum), when it is pathologically necessitated. The human will iscertainly an arbitrium sensitivum, not brutum, but liberum; becausesensuousness does not necessitate its action, a faculty existing in manof self-determination, independently of all sensuous coercion.It is plain that, if all causality in the world of sense werenatural—and natural only—every event would be determined by anotheraccording to necessary laws, and that, consequently, phenomena, in sofar as they determine the will, must necessitate every action as anatural effect from themselves; and thus all practical freedom wouldfall to the ground with the transcendental idea. For the latterpresupposes that although a certain thing has not happened, it ought tohave happened, and that, consequently, its phenomenal cause was not sopowerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our will—acausality capable of producing effects independently of and even inopposition to the power of natural causes, and capable, consequently,of spontaneously originating a series of events.Here, too, we find it to be the case, as we generally found in theself-contradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to passthe bounds of possible experience, that the problem is properly notphysiological, but transcendental. The question of the possibility offreedom does indeed concern psychology; but, as it rests upondialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution must engage theattention of transcendental philosophy. Before attempting thissolution, a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline, itwill be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in thesettlement of the question.If phenomena were things in themselves, and time and space forms of theexistence of things, condition and conditioned would always be membersof the same series; and thus would arise in the present case theantinomy common to all transcendental ideas—that their series is eithertoo great or too small for the understanding. The dynamical ideas,which we are about to discuss in this and the following section,possess the peculiarity of relating to an object, not considered as aquantity, but as an existence; and thus, in the discussion of thepresent question, we may make abstraction of the quantity of the seriesof conditions, and consider merely the dynamical relation of thecondition to the conditioned. The question, then, suggests itself,whether freedom is possible; and, if it is, whether it can consist withthe universality of the natural law of causality; and, consequently,whether we enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say: “Everyeffect must have its origin either in nature or in freedom,” or whetherboth cannot exist together in the same event in different relations.The principle of an unbroken connection between all events in thephenomenal world, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature,is a well-established principle of transcendental analytic which admitsof no exception. The question, therefore, is: “Whether an effect,determined according to the laws of nature, can at the same time beproduced by a free agent, or whether freedom and nature mutuallyexclude each other?” And here, the common but fallacious hypothesis ofthe absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious influence inembarrassing the procedure of reason. For if phenomena are things inthemselves, freedom is impossible. In this case, nature is the completeand all-sufficient cause of every event; and condition and conditioned,cause and effect are contained in the same series, and necessitated bythe same law. If, on the contrary, phenomena are held to be, as theyare in fact, nothing more than mere representations, connected witheach other in accordance with empirical laws, they must have a groundwhich is not phenomenal. But the causality of such an intelligiblecause is not determined or determinable by phenomena; although itseffects, as phenomena, must be determined by other phenomenalexistences. This cause and its causality exist therefore out of andapart from the series of phenomena; while its effects do exist and arediscoverable in the series of empirical conditions. Such an effect maytherefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligiblecause, and necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is anecessary consequence—a distinction which, stated in this perfectlygeneral and abstract manner, must appear in the highest degree subtleand obscure. The sequel will explain. It is sufficient, at present, toremark that, as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is anunalterable law of nature, freedom is impossible—on the suppositionthat phenomena are absolutely real. Hence those philosophers who adhereto the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconcilingthe ideas of nature and freedom._Possibility of Freedom in Harmony with the Universal Law of NaturalNecessity._That element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous, I maybe allowed to term intelligible. If, accordingly, an object which mustbe regarded as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is notan object of sensuous intuition, but by means of which it is capable ofbeing the cause of phenomena, the causality of an object or existenceof this kind may be regarded from two different points of view. It maybe considered to be intelligible, as regards its action—the action of athing which is a thing in itself, and sensuous, as regards itseffects—the effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world. Weshould accordingly, have to form both an empirical and an intellectualconception of the causality of such a faculty or power—both, however,having reference to the same effect. This twofold manner of cogitatinga power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any ofthe conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or ofa possible experience. Phenomena—not being things in themselves—musthave a transcendental object as a foundation, which determines them asmere representations; and there seems to be no reason why we should notascribe to this transcendental object, in addition to the property ofself-phenomenization, a causality whose effects are to be met with inthe world of phenomena, although it is not itself a phenomenon. Butevery effective cause must possess a character, that is to say, a lawof its causality, without which it would cease to be a cause. In theabove case, then, every sensuous object would possess an empiricalcharacter, which guaranteed that its actions, as phenomena, stand incomplete and harmonious connection, conformably to unvarying naturallaws, with all other phenomena, and can be deduced from these, asconditions, and that they do thus, in connection with these, constitutea series in the order of nature. This sensuous object must, in thesecond place, possess an intelligible character, which guarantees it tobe the cause of those actions, as phenomena, although it is not itselfa phenomenon nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense.The former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon,the latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself.Now this active subject would, in its character of intelligiblesubject, be subordinate to no conditions of time, for time is only acondition of phenomena, and not of things in themselves. No actionwould begin or cease to be in this subject; it would consequently befree from the law of all determination of time—the law of change,namely, that everything which happens must have a cause in thephenomena of a preceding state. In one word, the causality of thesubject, in so far as it is intelligible, would not form part of theseries of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an eventin the world of sense. Again, this intelligible character of a thingcannot be immediately cognized, because we can perceive nothing butphenomena, but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony withthe empirical character; for we always find ourselves compelled toplace, in thought, a transcendental object at the basis of phenomenaalthough we can never know what this object is in itself.In virtue of its empirical character, this subject would at the sametime be subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality, and, as aphenomenon and member of the sensuous world, its effects would have tobe accounted for by a reference to preceding phenomena. Eternalphenomena must be capable of influencing it; and its actions, inaccordance with natural laws, must explain to us how its empiricalcharacter, that is, the law of its causality, is to be cognized in andby means of experience. In a word, all requisites for a complete andnecessary determination of these actions must be presented to us byexperience.In virtue of its intelligible character, on the other hand (although wepossess only a general conception of this character), the subject mustbe regarded as free from all sensuous influences, and from allphenomenal determination. Moreover, as nothing happens in thissubject—for it is a noumenon, and there does not consequently exist init any change, demanding the dynamical determination of time, and forthe same reason no connection with phenomena as causes—this activeexistence must in its actions be free from and independent of naturalnecessity, for this necessity exists only in the world of phenomena. Itwould be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effectsin the world of sense from itself, although the action productive ofthese effects does not begin in itself. We should not be in this caseaffirming that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves,because they are always determined by prior empirical conditions—byvirtue of the empirical character, which is the phenomenon of theintelligible character—and are possible only as constituting acontinuation of the series of natural causes. And thus nature andfreedom, each in the complete and absolute signification of theseterms, can exist, without contradiction or disagreement, in the sameaction._Exposition of the Cosmological Idea of Freedom in Harmony with theUniversal Law of Natural Necessity._I have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely asketch of the solution of this transcendental problem, in order toenable him to form with greater ease a clear conception of the coursewhich reason must adopt in the solution. I shall now proceed to exhibitthe several momenta of this solution, and to consider them in theirorder.The natural law that everything which happens must have a cause, thatthe causality of this cause, that is, the action of the cause (whichcannot always have existed, but must be itself an event, for itprecedes in time some effect which it has originated), must have itselfa phenomenal cause, by which it is determined and, and, consequently,all events are empirically determined in an order of nature—this law, Isay, which lies at the foundation of the possibility of experience, andof a connected system of phenomena or nature is a law of theunderstanding, from which no departure, and to which no exception, canbe admitted. For to except even a single phenomenon from its operationis to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus toadmit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain.Thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes,in which, however, absolute totality cannot be found. But we need notdetain ourselves with this question, for it has already beensufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into whichreason falls, when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the seriesof phenomena. If we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion oftranscendental idealism, we shall find that neither nature nor freedomexists. Now the question is: “Whether, admitting the existence ofnatural necessity in the world of phenomena, it is possible to consideran effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an effect offreedom—or, whether these two modes of causality are contradictory andincompatible?”No phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series. Everyaction, in so far as it is productive of an event, is itself an eventor occurrence, and presupposes another preceding state, in which itscause existed. Thus everything that happens is but a continuation of aseries, and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world.The actions of natural causes are, accordingly, themselves effects, andpresuppose causes preceding them in time. A primal action which formsan absolute beginning, is beyond the causal power of phenomena.Now, is it absolutely necessary that, granting that all effects arephenomena, the causality of the cause of these effects must also be aphenomenon and belong to the empirical world? Is it not rather possiblethat, although every effect in the phenomenal world must be connectedwith an empirical cause, according to the universal law of nature, thisempirical causality may be itself the effect of a non-empirical andintelligible causality—its connection with natural causes remainingnevertheless intact? Such a causality would be considered, in referenceto phenomena, as the primal action of a cause, which is in so far,therefore, not phenomenal, but, by reason of this faculty or power,intelligible; although it must, at the same time, as a link in thechain of nature, be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world.A belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary, if weare required to look for and to present the natural conditions ofnatural events, that is to say, their causes. This being admitted asunexceptionably valid, the requirements of the understanding, whichrecognizes nothing but nature in the region of phenomena, aresatisfied, and our physical explanations of physical phenomena mayproceed in their regular course, without hindrance and withoutopposition. But it is no stumbling-block in the way, even assuming theidea to be a pure fiction, to admit that there are some natural causesin the possession of a faculty which is not empirical, butintelligible, inasmuch as it is not determined to action by empiricalconditions, but purely and solely upon grounds brought forward by theunderstanding—this action being still, when the cause is phenomenized,in perfect accordance with the laws of empirical causality. Thus theacting subject, as a causal phenomenon, would continue to preserve acomplete connection with nature and natural conditions; and thephenomenon only of the subject (with all its phenomenal causality)would contain certain conditions, which, if we ascend from theempirical to the transcendental object, must necessarily be regarded asintelligible. For, if we attend, in our inquiries with regard to causesin the world of phenomena, to the directions of nature alone, we neednot trouble ourselves about the relation in which the transcendentalsubject, which is completely unknown to us, stands to these phenomenaand their connection in nature. The intelligible ground of phenomena inthis subject does not concern empirical questions. It has to do onlywith pure thought; and, although the effects of this thought and actionof the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena, thesephenomena must nevertheless be capable of a full and completeexplanation, upon purely physical grounds and in accordance withnatural laws. And in this case we attend solely to their empirical andomit all consideration of their intelligible character (which is thetranscendental cause of the former) as completely unknown, except in sofar as it is exhibited by the latter as its empirical symbol. Now letus apply this to experience. Man is a phenomenon of the sensuous worldand, at the same time, therefore, a natural cause, the causality ofwhich must be regulated by empirical laws. As such, he must possess anempirical character, like all other natural phenomena. We remark thisempirical character in his actions, which reveal the presence ofcertain powers and faculties. If we consider inanimate or merely animalnature, we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any otherthan a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner. Butman, to whom nature reveals herself only through sense, cognizeshimself not only by his senses, but also through pure apperception; andthis in actions and internal determinations, which he cannot regard assensuous impressions. He is thus to himself, on the one hand, aphenomenon, but on the other hand, in respect of certain faculties, apurely intelligible object—intelligible, because its action cannot beascribed to sensuous receptivity. These faculties are understanding andreason. The latter, especially, is in a peculiar manner distinct fromall empirically-conditioned faculties, for it employs ideas alone inthe consideration of its objects, and by means of these determines theunderstanding, which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its ownconceptions, which, like the ideas of reason, are pure andnon-empirical.That reason possesses the faculty of causality, or that at least we arecompelled so to represent it, is evident from the imperatives, which inthe sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers.The words I ought express a species of necessity, and imply aconnection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to themind of man. Understanding knows nothing in nature but that which is,or has been, or will be. It would be absurd to say that anything innature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in whichit stands; indeed, the ought, when we consider merely the course ofnature, has neither application nor meaning. The question, “What oughtto happen in the sphere of nature?” is just as absurd as the question,“What ought to be the properties of a circle?” All that we are entitledto ask is, “What takes place in nature?” or, in the latter case, “Whatare the properties of a circle?”But the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action, theground of which is a pure conception; while the ground of a merelynatural action is, on the contrary, always a phenomenon. This actionmust certainly be possible under physical conditions, if it isprescribed by the moral imperative ought; but these physical or naturalconditions do not concern the determination of the will itself, theyrelate to its effects alone, and the consequences of the effect in theworld of phenomena. Whatever number of motives nature may present to mywill, whatever sensuous impulses—the moral ought it is beyond theirpower to produce. They may produce a volition, which, so far from beingnecessary, is always conditioned—a volition to which the oughtenunciated by reason, sets an aim and a standard, gives permission orprohibition. Be the object what it may, purely sensuous—as pleasure, orpresented by pure reason—as good, reason will not yield to groundswhich have an empirical origin. Reason will not follow the order ofthings presented by experience, but, with perfect spontaneity,rearranges them according to ideas, with which it compels empiricalconditions to agree. It declares, in the name of these ideas, certainactions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place andwhich perhaps never will take place; and yet presupposes that itpossesses the faculty of causality in relation to these actions. For,in the absence of this supposition, it could not expect its ideas toproduce certain effects in the world of experience.Now, let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reasondoes stand in a really causal relation to phenomena. In this case itmust—pure reason as it is—exhibit an empirical character. For everycause supposes a rule, according to which certain phenomena follow aseffects from the cause, and every rule requires uniformity in theseeffects; and this is the proper ground of the conception of a cause—asa faculty or power. Now this conception (of a cause) may be termed theempirical character of reason; and this character is a permanent one,while the effects produced appear, in conformity with the variousconditions which accompany and partly limit them, in various forms.Thus the volition of every man has an empirical character, which isnothing more than the causality of his reason, in so far as its effectsin the phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule, according towhich we are enabled to examine, in their several kinds and degrees,the actions of this causality and the rational grounds for theseactions, and in this way to decide upon the subjective principles ofthe volition. Now we learn what this empirical character is only fromphenomenal effects, and from the rule of these which is presented byexperience; and for this reason all the actions of man in the world ofphenomena are determined by his empirical character, and theco-operative causes of nature. If, then, we could investigate all thephenomena of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind,there would be no action which we could not anticipate with certainty,and recognize to be absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions.So far as relates to this empirical character, therefore, there can beno freedom; and it is only in the light of this character that we canconsider the human will, when we confine ourselves to simpleobservation and, as is the case in anthropology, institute aphysiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions.But when we consider the same actions in relation to reason—not for thepurpose of explaining their origin, that is, in relation to speculativereason, but to practical reason, as the producing cause of theseactions—we shall discover a rule and an order very different from thoseof nature and experience. For the declaration of this mental facultymay be that what has and could not but take place in the course ofnature, ought not to have taken place. Sometimes, too, we discover, orbelieve that we discover, that the ideas of reason did actually standin a causal relation to certain actions of man; and that these actionshave taken place because they were determined, not by empirical causes,but by the act of the will upon grounds of reason.Now, granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena; canan action of reason be called free, when we know that, sensuously, inits empirical character, it is completely determined and absolutelynecessary? But this empirical character is itself determined by theintelligible character. The latter we cannot cognize; we can onlyindicate it by means of phenomena, which enable us to have an immediatecognition only of the empirical character.[63] An action, then, in sofar as it is to be ascribed to an intelligible cause, does not resultfrom it in accordance with empirical laws. That is to say, not theconditions of pure reason, but only their effects in the internalsense, precede the act. Pure reason, as a purely intelligible faculty,is not subject to the conditions of time. The causality of reason inits intelligible character does not begin to be; it does not make itsappearance at a certain time, for the purpose of producing an effect.If this were not the case, the causality of reason would be subservientto the natural law of phenomena, which determines them according totime, and as a series of causes and effects in time; it wouldconsequently cease to be freedom and become a part of nature. We aretherefore justified in saying: “If reason stands in a causal relationto phenomena, it is a faculty which originates the sensuous conditionof an empirical series of effects.” For the condition, which resides inthe reason, is non-sensuous, and therefore cannot be originated, orbegin to be. And thus we find—what we could not discover in anyempirical series—a condition of a successive series of events itselfempirically unconditioned. For, in the present case, the conditionstands out of and beyond the series of phenomena—it is intelligible,and it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition, orto any time-determination by a preceding cause. [63] The real morality of actions—their merit or demerit, and even that of our own conduct, is completely unknown to us. Our estimates can relate only to their empirical character. How much is the result of the action of free will, how much is to be ascribed to nature and to blameless error, or to a happy constitution of temperament (merito fortunae), no one can discover, nor, for this reason, determine with perfect justice.But, in another respect, the same cause belongs also to the series ofphenomena. Man is himself a phenomenon. His will has an empiricalcharacter, which is the empirical cause of all his actions. There is nocondition—determining man and his volition in conformity with thischaracter—which does not itself form part of the series of effects innature, and is subject to their law—the law according to which anempirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist. Forthis reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneousorigination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world ofexperience. But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which itdetermines the will is always preceded by some other state determiningit. For reason is not a phenomenon, and therefore not subject tosensuous conditions; and, consequently, even in relation to itscausality, the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason,nor can the dynamical law of nature, which determines the sequence oftime according to certain rules, be applied to it.Reason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of thehuman will. Each of these is determined in the empirical character ofthe man, even before it has taken place. The intelligible character, ofwhich the former is but the sensuous schema, knows no before or after;and every action, irrespective of the time-relation in which it standswith other phenomena, is the immediate effect of the intelligiblecharacter of pure reason, which, consequently, enjoys freedom ofaction, and is not dynamically determined either by internal orexternal preceding conditions. This freedom must not be described, in amerely negative manner, as independence of empirical conditions, for inthis case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena;but it must be regarded, positively, as a faculty which canspontaneously originate a series of events. At the same time, it mustnot be supposed that any beginning can take place in reason; on thecontrary, reason, as the unconditioned condition of all action of thewill, admits of no time-conditions, although its effect does reallybegin in a series of phenomena—a beginning which is not, however,absolutely primal.I shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example,from its employment in the world of experience; proved it cannot be byany amount of experience, or by any number of facts, for such argumentscannot establish the truth of transcendental propositions. Let us takea voluntary action—for example, a falsehood—by means of which a man hasintroduced a certain degree of confusion into the social life ofhumanity, which is judged according to the motives from which itoriginated, and the blame of which and of the evil consequences arisingfrom it, is imputed to the offender. We at first proceed to examine theempirical character of the offence, and for this purpose we endeavourto penetrate to the sources of that character, such as a defectiveeducation, bad company, a shameless and wicked disposition, frivolity,and want of reflection—not forgetting also the occasioning causes whichprevailed at the moment of the transgression. In this the procedure isexactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series ofcauses which determine a given physical effect. Now, although webelieve the action to have been determined by all these circumstances,we do not the less blame the offender. We do not blame him for hisunhappy disposition, nor for the circumstances which influenced him,nay, not even for his former course of life; for we presuppose that allthese considerations may be set aside, that the series of precedingconditions may be regarded as having never existed, and that the actionmay be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any statepreceding, just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely newseries of effects. Our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law ofreason, which requires us to regard this faculty as a cause, whichcould have and ought to have otherwise determined the behaviour of theculprit, independently of all empirical conditions. This causality ofreason we do not regard as a co-operating agency, but as complete initself. It matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured oropposed the action of this causality, the offence is estimatedaccording to its intelligible character—the offender is decidedlyworthy of blame, the moment he utters a falsehood. It follows that weregard reason, in spite of the empirical conditions of the act, ascompletely free, and therefore, as in the present case,culpable.The above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed tothink that reason is not affected by sensuous conditions, that in it nochange takes place—although its phenomena, in other words, the mode inwhich it appears in its effects, are subject to change—that in it nopreceding state determines the following, and, consequently, that itdoes not form a member of the series of sensuous conditions whichnecessitate phenomena according to natural laws. Reason is present andthe same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itselfexist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which itdid not formerly exist. It is, relatively to new states or conditions,determining, but not determinable. Hence we cannot ask: “Why did notreason determine itself in a different manner?” The question ought tobe thus stated: “Why did not reason employ its power of causality todetermine certain phenomena in a different manner?” But this is aquestion which admits of no answer. For a different intelligiblecharacter would have exhibited a different empirical character; and,when we say that, in spite of the course which his whole former lifehas taken, the offender could have refrained from uttering thefalsehood, this means merely that the act was subject to the power andauthority—permissive or prohibitive—of reason. Now, reason is notsubject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time; anda difference in time may produce a difference in the relation ofphenomena to each other—for these are not things and therefore notcauses in themselves—but it cannot produce any difference in therelation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason.Thus, then, in our investigation into free actions and the causal powerwhich produced them, we arrive at an intelligible cause, beyond which,however, we cannot go; although we can recognize that it is free, thatis, independent of all sensuous conditions, and that, in this way, itmay be the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena. But forwhat reason the intelligible character generates such and suchphenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character undercertain circumstances, it is beyond the power of our reason to decide.The question is as much above the power and the sphere of reason as thefollowing would be: “Why does the transcendental object of our externalsensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition inspace?” But the problem, which we were called upon to solve, does notrequire us to entertain any such questions. The problem was merelythis—whether freedom and natural necessity can exist without oppositionin the same action. To this question we have given a sufficient answer;for we have shown that, as the former stands in a relation to adifferent kind of condition from those of the latter, the law of theone does not affect the law of the other and that, consequently, bothcan exist together in independence of and without interference witheach other.The reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the aboveremarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom, as afaculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena. For,not to mention that such an argument would not have a transcendentalcharacter, nor have been limited to the discussion of pureconceptions—all attempts at inferring from experience what cannot becogitated in accordance with its laws, must ever be unsuccessful. Nay,more, I have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility offreedom; for this too would have been a vain endeavour, inasmuch as itis beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a realityor of a causal power by the aid of mere à priori conceptions. Freedomhas been considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendentalidea, by means of which reason aims at originating a series ofconditions in the world of phenomena with the help of that which issensuously unconditioned, involving itself, however, in an antinomywith the laws which itself prescribes for the conduct of theunderstanding. That this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion, andthat nature and freedom are at least not opposed—this was the onlything in our power to prove, and the question which it was our task tosolve.IV. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Dependenceof Phenomenal ExistencesIn the preceding remarks, we considered the changes in the world ofsense as constituting a dynamical series, in which each member issubordinated to another—as its cause. Our present purpose is to availourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to anexistence which may be the highest condition of all changeablephenomena, that is, to a necessary being. Our endeavour to reach, notthe unconditioned causality, but the unconditioned existence, ofsubstance. The series before us is therefore a series of conceptions,and not of intuitions (in which the one intuition is the condition ofthe other).But it is evident that, as all phenomena are subject to change andconditioned in their existence, the series of dependent existencescannot embrace an unconditioned member, the existence of which would beabsolutely necessary. It follows that, if phenomena were things inthemselves, and—as an immediate consequence from thissupposition—condition and conditioned belonged to the same series ofphenomena, the existence of a necessary being, as the condition of theexistence of sensuous phenomena, would be perfectly impossible.An important distinction, however, exists between the dynamical and themathematical regress. The latter is engaged solely with the combinationof parts into a whole, or with the division of a whole into its parts;and therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series, andto be consequently regarded as homogeneous, and for this reason, asconsisting, without exception, of phenomena. If the former regress, onthe contrary, the aim of which is not to establish the possibility ofan unconditioned whole consisting of given parts, or of anunconditioned part of a given whole, but to demonstrate the possibilityof the deduction of a certain state from its cause, or of thecontingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily,it is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empiricalseries along with the conditioned.In the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at presentdealing, there exists a way of escape from the difficulty; for it isnot impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true indifferent relations. All sensuous phenomena may be contingent, andconsequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence, and yetthere may also exist a non-empirical condition of the whole series, or,in other words, a necessary being. For this necessary being, as anintelligible condition, would not form a member—not even the highestmember—of the series; the whole world of sense would be left in itsempirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced.This would also form a ground of distinction between the modes ofsolution employed for the third and fourth antinomies. For, while inthe consideration of freedom in the former antinomy, the thingitself—the cause (substantia phaenomenon)—was regarded as belonging tothe series of conditions, and only its causality to the intelligibleworld—we are obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessarybeing as purely intelligible and as existing entirely apart from theworld of sense (as an ens extramundanum); for otherwise it would besubject to the phenomenal law of contingency and dependence.In relation to the present problem, therefore, the regulative principleof reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses anempirically conditioned existence—that no property of the sensuousworld possesses unconditioned necessity—that we are bound to expect,and, so far as is possible, to seek for the empirical condition ofevery member in the series of conditions—and that there is nosufficient reason to justify us in deducing any existence from acondition which lies out of and beyond the empirical series, or inregarding any existence as independent and self-subsistent; althoughthis should not prevent us from recognizing the possibility of thewhole series being based upon a being which is intelligible, and forthis reason free from all empirical conditions.But it has been far from my intention, in these remarks, to prove theexistence of this unconditioned and necessary being, or even toevidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of theexistence of all sensuous phenomena. As bounds were set to reason, toprevent it from leaving the guiding thread of empirical conditions andlosing itself in transcendent theories which are incapable of concretepresentation; so it was my purpose, on the other hand, to set bounds tothe law of the purely empirical understanding, and to protest againstany attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things, ordeclaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible, merely onthe ground that it is not available for the explanation and expositionof phenomena. It has been shown, at the same time, that the contingencyof all the phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quiteconsistent with the arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary, althoughpurely intelligible condition, that no real contradiction existsbetween them and that, consequently, both may be true. The existence ofsuch an absolutely necessary being may be impossible; but this cannever be demonstrated from the universal contingency and dependence ofsensuous phenomena, nor from the principle which forbids us todiscontinue the series at some member of it, or to seek for its causein some sphere of existence beyond the world of nature. Reason goes itsway in the empirical world, and follows, too, its peculiar path in thesphere of the transcendental.The sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena, which are mererepresentations, and always sensuously conditioned; things inthemselves are not, and cannot be, objects to us. It is not to bewondered at, therefore, that we are not justified in leaping from somemember of an empirical series beyond the world of sense, as ifempirical representations were things in themselves, existing apartfrom their transcendental ground in the human mind, and the cause ofwhose existence may be sought out of the empirical series. This wouldcertainly be the case with contingent things; but it cannot be withmere representations of things, the contingency of which is itselfmerely a phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that whichdetermines phenomena, that is, the empirical. But to cogitate anintelligible ground of phenomena, as free, moreover, from thecontingency of the latter, conflicts neither with the unlimited natureof the empirical regress, nor with the complete contingency ofphenomena. And the demonstration of this was the only thing necessaryfor the solution of this apparent antinomy. For if the condition ofevery conditioned—as regards its existence—is sensuous, and for thisreason a part of the same series, it must be itself conditioned, as wasshown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy. The embarrassments intowhich a reason, which postulates the unconditioned, necessarily falls,must, therefore, continue to exist; or the unconditioned must be placedin the sphere of the intelligible. In this way, its necessity does notrequire, nor does it even permit, the presence of an empiricalcondition: and it is, consequently, unconditionally necessary.The empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption ofa purely intelligible being; it continues its operations on theprinciple of the contingency of all phenomena, proceeding fromempirical conditions to still higher and higher conditions, themselvesempirical. Just as little does this regulative principle exclude theassumption of an intelligible cause, when the question regards merelythe pure employment of reason—in relation to ends or aims. For, in thiscase, an intelligible cause signifies merely the transcendental and tous unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous phenomena, and itsexistence, necessary and independent of all sensuous conditions, is notinconsistent with the contingency of phenomena, or with the unlimitedpossibility of regress which exists in the series of empiricalconditions.Concluding Remarks on the Antinomy of Pure Reason.So long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality ofconditions in the world of phenomena, and the satisfaction, from thissource, of the requirements of reason, so long are our ideastranscendental and cosmological. But when we set theunconditioned—which is the aim of all our inquiries—in a sphere whichlies out of the world of sense and possible experience, our ideasbecome transcendent. They are then not merely serviceable towards thecompletion of the exercise of reason (which remains an idea, neverexecuted, but always to be pursued); they detach themselves completelyfrom experience and construct for themselves objects, the material ofwhich has not been presented by experience, and the objective realityof which is not based upon the completion of the empirical series, butupon pure à priori conceptions. The intelligible object of thesetranscendent ideas may be conceded, as a transcendental object. But wecannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinctpredicates relating to its internal nature, for it has no connectionwith empirical conceptions; nor are we justified in affirming theexistence of any such object. It is, consequently, a mere product ofthe mind alone. Of all the cosmological ideas, however, it is thatoccasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon thisstep. For the existence of phenomena, always conditioned and neverself-subsistent, requires us to look for an object different fromphenomena—an intelligible object, with which all contingency mustcease. But, as we have allowed ourselves to assume the existence of aself-subsistent reality out of the field of experience, and aretherefore obliged to regard phenomena as merely a contingent mode ofrepresenting intelligible objects employed by beings which arethemselves intelligences—no other course remains for us than to followanalogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception ofintelligible things, of which we have not the least knowledge, whichnature taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions.Experience made us acquainted with the contingent. But we are atpresent engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects ofexperience; and must, therefore, deduce our knowledge of them from thatwhich is necessary absolutely and in itself, that is, from pureconceptions. Hence the first step which we take out of the world ofsense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with theinvestigation of a necessary being, and to deduce from our conceptionsof it all our conceptions of intelligible things. This we propose toattempt in the following chapter.Chapter III. The Ideal of Pure ReasonSection I. Of the Ideal in GeneralWe have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind,except under sensuous conditions; because the conditions of objectivereality do not exist in these conceptions, which contain, in fact,nothing but the mere form of thought. They may, however, when appliedto phenomena, be presented in concreto; for it is phenomena thatpresent to them the materials for the formation of empiricalconceptions, which are nothing more than concrete forms of theconceptions of the understanding. But ideas are still further removedfrom objective reality than categories; for no phenomenon can everpresent them to the human mind in concreto. They contain a certainperfection, attainable by no possible empirical cognition; and theygive to reason a systematic unity, to which the unity of experienceattempts to approximate, but can never completely attain.But still further removed than the idea from objective reality is theIdeal, by which term I understand the idea, not in concreto, but inindividuo—as an individual thing, determinable or determined by theidea alone. The idea of humanity in its complete perfection supposesnot only the advancement of all the powers and faculties, whichconstitute our conception of human nature, to a complete attainment oftheir final aims, but also everything which is requisite for thecomplete determination of the idea; for of all contradictorypredicates, only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man. WhatI have termed an ideal was in Plato’s philosophy an idea of the divinemind—an individual object present to its pure intuition, the mostperfect of every kind of possible beings, and the archetype of allphenomenal existences.Without rising to these speculative heights, we are bound to confessthat human reason contains not only ideas, but ideals, which possess,not, like those of Plato, creative, but certainly practical power—asregulative principles, and form the basis of the perfectibility ofcertain actions. Moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptionsof reason, because an empirical element—of pleasure or pain—lies at thefoundation of them. In relation, however, to the principle, wherebyreason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law, andconsequently when we attend merely to their form, they may beconsidered as pure conceptions of reason. Virtue and wisdom in theirperfect purity are ideas. But the wise man of the Stoics is an ideal,that is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in completeconformity with the idea of wisdom. As the idea provides a rule, so theideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determinationof the copy. Thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us asa standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves,which may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection itdemands can never be attained by us. Although we cannot concedeobjective reality to these ideals, they are not to be considered aschimeras; on the contrary, they provide reason with a standard, whichenables it to estimate, by comparison, the degree of incompleteness inthe objects presented to it. But to aim at realizing the ideal in anexample in the world of experience—to describe, for instance, thecharacter of the perfectly wise man in a romance—is impracticable. Naymore, there is something absurd in the attempt; and the result must belittle edifying, as the natural limitations, which are continuallybreaking in upon the perfection and completeness of the idea, destroythe illusion in the story and throw an air of suspicion even on what isgood in the idea, which hence appears fictitious and unreal.Such is the constitution of the ideal of reason, which is always basedupon determinate conceptions, and serves as a rule and a model forlimitation or of criticism. Very different is the nature of the idealsof the imagination. Of these it is impossible to present anintelligible conception; they are a kind of monogram, drawn accordingto no determinate rule, and forming rather a vague picture—theproduction of many diverse experiences—than a determinate image. Suchare the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have intheir minds, and which can serve neither as a model for production noras a standard for appreciation. They may be termed, though improperly,sensuous ideals, as they are declared to be models of certain possibleempirical intuitions. They cannot, however, furnish rules or standardsfor explanation or examination.In its ideals, reason aims at complete and perfect determinationaccording to à priori rules; and hence it cogitates an object, whichmust be completely determinable in conformity with principles, althoughall empirical conditions are absent, and the conception of the objectis on this account transcendent.Section II. Of the Transcendental Ideal (Prototypon Trancendentale)Every conception is, in relation to that which is not contained in it,undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability. Thisprinciple is that, of every two contradictorily opposed predicates,only one can belong to a conception. It is a purely logical principle,itself based upon the principle of contradiction; inasmuch as it makescomplete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logicalform of the cognition.But again, everything, as regards its possibility, is also subject tothe principle of complete determination, according to which one of allthe possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it. Thisprinciple is not based merely upon that of contradiction; for, inaddition to the relation between two contradictory predicates, itregards everything as standing in a relation to the sum ofpossibilities, as the sum total of all predicates of things, and, whilepresupposing this sum as an à priori condition, presents to the mindeverything as receiving the possibility of its individual existencefrom the relation it bears to, and the share it possesses in, theaforesaid sum of possibilities.[64] The principle of completedetermination relates the content and not to the logical form. It isthe principle of the synthesis of all the predicates which are requiredto constitute the complete conception of a thing, and not a mereprinciple analytical representation, which enounces that one of twocontradictory predicates must belong to a conception. It contains,moreover, a transcendental presupposition—that, namely, of the materialfor all possibility, which must contain à priori the data for this orthat particular possibility. [64] Thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to a common correlate—the sum-total of possibility, which, if discovered to exist in the idea of one individual thing, would establish the affinity of all possible things, from the identity of the ground of their complete determination. The determinability of every conception is subordinate to the universality (Allgemeinheit, universalitas) of the principle of excluded middle; the determination of a thing to the totality (Allheit, universitas) of all possible predicates.The proposition, everything which exists is completely determined,means not only that one of every pair of given contradictoryattributes, but that one of all possible attributes, is alwayspredicable of the thing; in it the predicates are not merely comparedlogically with each other, but the thing itself is transcendentallycompared with the sum-total of all possible predicates. The propositionis equivalent to saying: “To attain to a complete knowledge of a thing,it is necessary to possess a knowledge of everything that is possible,and to determine it thereby in a positive or negative manner.” Theconception of complete determination is consequently a conception whichcannot be presented in its totality in concreto, and is therefore basedupon an idea, which has its seat in the reason—the faculty whichprescribes to the understanding the laws of its harmonious and perfectexercise.Now, although this idea of the sum-total of all possibility, in so faras it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything,is itself undetermined in relation to the predicates which mayconstitute this sum-total, and we cogitate in it merely the sum-totalof all possible predicates—we nevertheless find, upon closerexamination, that this idea, as a primitive conception of the mind,excludes a large number of predicates—those deduced and thoseirreconcilable with others, and that it is evolved as a conceptioncompletely determined à priori. Thus it becomes the conception of anindividual object, which is completely determined by and through themere idea, and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason.When we consider all possible predicates, not merely logically, buttranscendentally, that is to say, with reference to the content whichmay be cogitated as existing in them à priori, we shall find that someindicate a being, others merely a non-being. The logical negationexpressed in the word not does not properly belong to a conception, butonly to the relation of one conception to another in a judgement, andis consequently quite insufficient to present to the mind the contentof a conception. The expression not mortal does not indicate that anon-being is cogitated in the object; it does not concern the contentat all. A transcendental negation, on the contrary, indicates non-beingin itself, and is opposed to transcendental affirmation, the conceptionof which of itself expresses a being. Hence this affirmation indicatesa reality, because in and through it objects are considered to besomething—to be things; while the opposite negation, on the other hand,indicates a mere want, or privation, or absence, and, where suchnegations alone are attached to a representation, the non-existence ofanything corresponding to the representation.Now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined, without cogitating atthe same time the opposite affirmation. The man born blind has not theleast notion of darkness, because he has none of light; the vagabondknows nothing of poverty, because he has never known what it is to bein comfort;[65] the ignorant man has no conception of his ignorance,because he has no conception of knowledge. All conceptions of negativesare accordingly derived or deduced conceptions; and realities containthe data, and, so to speak, the material or transcendental content ofthe possibility and complete determination of all things. [65] The investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us much that is wonderful; but the most important lesson we have received from them is the discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation to the universe—an ignorance the magnitude of which reason, without the information thus derived, could never have conceived. This discovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the determination of the aims of human reason.If, therefore, a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation ofthe complete determination of things—a substratum which is to form thefund from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied,this substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sum-total ofreality (omnitudo realitatis). In this view, negations are nothing butlimitations—a term which could not, with propriety, be applied to them,if the unlimited (the all) did not form the true basis of ourconception.This conception of a sum-total of reality is the conception of a thingin itself, regarded as completely determined; and the conception of anens realissimum is the conception of an individual being, inasmuch asit is determined by that predicate of all possible contradictorypredicates, which indicates and belongs to being. It is, therefore, atranscendental ideal which forms the basis of the completedetermination of everything that exists, and is the highest materialcondition of its possibility—a condition on which must rest thecogitation of all objects with respect to their content. Nay, more,this ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable;because in this case alone a general conception of a thing iscompletely determined by and through itself, and cognized as therepresentation of an individuum.The logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctivesyllogism, the major of which contains the logical division of theextent of a general conception, the minor limits this extent to acertain part, while the conclusion determines the conception by thispart. The general conception of a reality cannot be divided à priori,because, without the aid of experience, we cannot know any determinatekinds of reality, standing under the former as the genus. Thetranscendental principle of the complete determination of all things istherefore merely the representation of the sum-total of all reality; itis not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself,but one which comprehends them all within itself. The completedetermination of a thing is consequently based upon the limitation ofthis total of reality, so much being predicated of the thing, while allthat remains over is excluded—a procedure which is in exact agreementwith that of the disjunctive syllogism and the determination of theobjects in the conclusion by one of the members of the division. Itfollows that reason, in laying the transcendental ideal at thefoundation of its determination of all possible things, takes a coursein exact analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogisms—aproposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of alltranscendental ideas, according to which they are produced in completeparallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed bythe human mind.It is self-evident that reason, in cogitating the necessary completedetermination of things, does not presuppose the existence of a beingcorresponding to its ideal, but merely the idea of the ideal—for thepurpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of completedetermination, The ideal is therefore the prototype of all things,which, as defective copies (ectypa), receive from it the material oftheir possibility, and approximate to it more or less, though it isimpossible that they can ever attain to its perfection.The possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derived—exceptthat of the thing which contains in itself all reality, which must beconsidered to be primitive and original. For all negations—and they arethe only predicates by means of which all other things can bedistinguished from the ens realissimum—are mere limitations of agreater and a higher—nay, the highest reality; and they consequentlypresuppose this reality, and are, as regards their content, derivedfrom it. The manifold nature of things is only an infinitely variousmode of limiting the conception of the highest reality, which is theircommon substratum; just as all figures are possible only as differentmodes of limiting infinite space. The object of the ideal of reason—anobject existing only in reason itself—is also termed the primal being(ens originarium); as having no existence superior to him, the supremebeing (ens summum); and as being the condition of all other beings,which rank under it, the being of all beings (ens entium). But none ofthese terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existingobject to other things, but merely that of an idea to conceptions; andall our investigations into this subject still leave us in perfectuncertainty with regard to the existence of this being.A primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with anexistence which is derivative, for the latter presuppose the former,and therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it. It follows that theideal of the primal being must be cogitated as simple.The deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primalbeing cannot, strictly speaking, be considered as a limitation, or as akind of division of its reality; for this would be regarding the primalbeing as a mere aggregate—which has been shown to be impossible,although it was so represented in our first rough sketch. The highestreality must be regarded rather as the ground than as the sum-total ofthe possibility of all things, and the manifold nature of things bebased, not upon the limitation of the primal being itself, but upon thecomplete series of effects which flow from it. And thus all our powersof sense, as well as all phenomenal reality, may be with proprietyregarded as belonging to this series of effects, while they could nothave formed parts of the idea, considered as an aggregate. Pursuingthis track, and hypostatizing this idea, we shall find ourselvesauthorized to determine our notion of the Supreme Being by means of themere conception of a highest reality, as one, simple, all-sufficient,eternal, and so on—in one word, to determine it in its unconditionedcompleteness by the aid of every possible predicate. The conception ofsuch a being is the conception of God in its transcendental sense, andthus the ideal of pure reason is the object-matter of a transcendentaltheology.But, by such an employment of the transcendental idea, we should beover stepping the limits of its validity and purpose. For reason placedit, as the conception of all reality, at the basis of the completedetermination of things, without requiring that this conception beregarded as the conception of an objective existence. Such an existencewould be purely fictitious, and the hypostatizing of the content of theidea into an ideal, as an individual being, is a step perfectlyunauthorized. Nay, more, we are not even called upon to assume thepossibility of such an hypothesis, as none of the deductions drawn fromsuch an ideal would affect the complete determination of things ingeneral—for the sake of which alone is the idea necessary.It is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic ofreason; we must also endeavour to discover the sources of thisdialectic, that we may have it in our power to give a rationalexplanation of this illusion, as a phenomenon of the human mind. Forthe ideal, of which we are at present speaking, is based, not upon anarbitrary, but upon a natural, idea. The question hence arises: Howhappens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deducedfrom a single possibility, that, to wit, of the highest reality, andpresupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being?The answer is ready; it is at once presented by the procedure oftranscendental analytic. The possibility of sensuous objects is arelation of these objects to thought, in which something (the empiricalform) may be cogitated à priori; while that which constitutes thematter—the reality of the phenomenon (that element which corresponds tosensation)—must be given from without, as otherwise it could not evenbe cogitated by, nor could its possibility be presentable to the mind.Now, a sensuous object is completely determined, when it has beencompared with all phenomenal predicates, and represented by means ofthese either positively or negatively. But, as that which constitutesthe thing itself—the real in a phenomenon, must be given, and that, inwhich the real of all phenomena is given, is experience, one, sole, andall-embracing—the material of the possibility of all sensuous objectsmust be presupposed as given in a whole, and it is upon the limitationof this whole that the possibility of all empirical objects, theirdistinction from each other and their complete determination, arebased. Now, no other objects are presented to us besides sensuousobjects, and these can be given only in connection with a possibleexperience; it follows that a thing is not an object to us, unless itpresupposes the whole or sum-total of empirical reality as thecondition of its possibility. Now, a natural illusion leads us toconsider this principle, which is valid only of sensuous objects, asvalid with regard to things in general. And thus we are induced to holdthe empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility ofthings, as phenomena, by leaving out this limitative condition, to be atranscendental principle of the possibility of things in general.We proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sum-total of allreality, by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exerciseof the understanding into the collective unity of an empirical whole—adialectical illusion, and by cogitating this whole or sum of experienceas an individual thing, containing in itself all empirical reality.This individual thing or being is then, by means of the above-mentionedtranscendental subreption, substituted for our notion of a thing whichstands at the head of the possibility of all things, the realconditions of whose complete determination it presents.[66] [66] This ideal of the ens realissimum—although merely a mental representation—is first objectivized, that is, has an objective existence attributed to it, then hypostatized, and finally, by the natural progress of reason to the completion of unity, personified, as we shall show presently. For the regulative unity of experience is not based upon phenomena themselves, but upon the connection of the variety of phenomena by the understanding in a consciousness, and thus the unity of the supreme reality and the complete determinability of all things, seem to reside in a supreme understanding, and, consequently, in a conscious intelligence.Section III. Of the Arguments employed by Speculative Reason in Proofof the Existence of a Supreme BeingNotwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels, to form somepresupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis forthe complete determination of its conceptions, the idealistic andfactitious nature of such a presupposition is too evident to allowreason for a moment to persuade itself into a belief of the objectiveexistence of a mere creation of its own thought. But there are otherconsiderations which compel reason to seek out some resting place inthe regress from the conditioned to the unconditioned, which is notgiven as an actual existence from the mere conception of it, althoughit alone can give completeness to the series of conditions. And this isthe natural course of every human reason, even of the most uneducated,although the path at first entered it does not always continue tofollow. It does not begin from conceptions, but from common experience,and requires a basis in actual existence. But this basis is insecure,unless it rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary.And this foundation is itself unworthy of trust, if it leave under andabove it empty space, if it do not fill all, and leave no room for awhy or a wherefore, if it be not, in one word, infinite in its reality.If we admit the existence of some one thing, whatever it may be, wemust also admit that there is something which exists necessarily. Forwhat is contingent exists only under the condition of some other thing,which is its cause; and from this we must go on to conclude theexistence of a cause which is not contingent, and which consequentlyexists necessarily and unconditionally. Such is the argument by whichreason justifies its advances towards a primal being.Now reason looks round for the conception of a being that may beadmitted, without inconsistency, to be worthy of the attribute ofabsolute necessity, not for the purpose of inferring à priori, from theconception of such a being, its objective existence (for if reasonallowed itself to take this course, it would not require a basis ingiven and actual existence, but merely the support of pureconceptions), but for the purpose of discovering, among all ourconceptions of possible things, that conception which possesses noelement inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity. For thatthere must be some absolutely necessary existence, it regards as atruth already established. Now, if it can remove every existenceincapable of supporting the attribute of absolute necessity, exceptingone—this must be the absolutely necessary being, whether its necessityis comprehensible by us, that is, deducible from the conception of italone, or not.Now that, the conception of which contains a therefore to everywherefore, which is not defective in any respect whatever, which isall-sufficient as a condition, seems to be the being of which we canjustly predicate absolute necessity—for this reason, that, possessingthe conditions of all that is possible, it does not and cannot itselfrequire any condition. And thus it satisfies, in one respect at least,the requirements of the conception of absolute necessity. In this view,it is superior to all other conceptions, which, as deficient andincomplete, do not possess the characteristic of independence of allhigher conditions. It is true that we cannot infer from this that whatdoes not contain in itself the supreme and complete condition—thecondition of all other things—must possess only a conditionedexistence; but as little can we assert the contrary, for this supposedbeing does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reasonto cognize by means of an à priori conception the unconditioned andnecessary nature of its existence.The conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with theconception of an unconditioned and necessary being. The formerconception does not satisfy all the requirements of the latter; but wehave no choice, we are obliged to adhere to it, for we find that wecannot do without the existence of a necessary being; and even althoughwe admit it, we find it out of our power to discover in the wholesphere of possibility any being that can advance well-grounded claimsto such a distinction.The following is, therefore, the natural course of human reason. Itbegins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being.In this being it recognizes the characteristics of unconditionedexistence. It then seeks the conception of that which is independent ofall conditions, and finds it in that which is itself the sufficientcondition of all other things—in other words, in that which containsall reality. But the unlimited all is an absolute unity, and isconceived by the mind as a being one and supreme; and thus reasonconcludes that the Supreme Being, as the primal basis of all things,possesses an existence which is absolutely necessary.This conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if weadmit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that thereexists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions.In such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have nochoice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of theabsolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of thepossibility of things. But if there exists no motive for coming to adefinite conclusion, and we may leave the question unanswered till wehave fully weighed both sides—in other words, when we are merely calledupon to decide how much we happen to know about the question, and howmuch we merely flatter ourselves that we know—the above conclusion doesnot appear to be so great advantage, but, on the contrary, seemsdefective in the grounds upon which it is supported.For, admitting the truth of all that has been said, that, namely, theinference from a given existence (my own, for example) to the existenceof an unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable;that, in the second place, we must consider a being which contains allreality, and consequently all the conditions of other things, to beabsolutely unconditioned; and admitting too, that we have thusdiscovered the conception of a thing to which may be attributed,without inconsistency, absolute necessity—it does not follow from allthis that the conception of a limited being, in which the supremereality does not reside, is therefore incompatible with the idea ofabsolute necessity. For, although I do not discover the element of theunconditioned in the conception of such a being—an element which ismanifestly existent in the sum-total of all conditions—I am notentitled to conclude that its existence is therefore conditioned; justas I am not entitled to affirm, in a hypothetical syllogism, that wherea certain condition does not exist (in the present, completeness, asfar as pure conceptions are concerned), the conditioned does not existeither. On the contrary, we are free to consider all limited beings aslikewise unconditionally necessary, although we are unable to inferthis from the general conception which we have of them. Thus conducted,this argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of theproperties of a necessary being, and must be in every respect withoutresult.This argument continues, however, to possess a weight and an authority,which, in spite of its objective insufficiency, it has never beendivested of. For, granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us,which, as based on the ideas of reason, deserve to be respected andsubmitted to, although they are incapable of a real or practicalapplication to our nature, or, in other words, would beresponsibilities without motives, except upon the supposition of aSupreme Being to give effect and influence to the practical laws: insuch a case we should be bound to obey our conceptions, which, althoughobjectively insufficient, do, according to the standard of reason,preponderate over and are superior to any claims that may be advancedfrom any other quarter. The equilibrium of doubt would in this case bedestroyed by a practical addition; indeed, Reason would be compelled tocondemn herself, if she refused to comply with the demands of thejudgement, no superior to which we know—however defective herunderstanding of the grounds of these demands might be.This argument, although in fact transcendental, inasmuch as it restsupon the intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent, is so simple andnatural, that the commonest understanding can appreciate its value. Wesee things around us change, arise, and pass away; they, or theircondition, must therefore have a cause. The same demand must again bemade of the cause itself—as a datum of experience. Now it is naturalthat we should place the highest causality just where we place supremecausality, in that being, which contains the conditions of all possibleeffects, and the conception of which is so simple as that of anall-embracing reality. This highest cause, then, we regard asabsolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to riseto it, and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it. Thus,among all nations, through the darkest polytheism glimmer some faintsparks of monotheism, to which these idolaters have been led, not fromreflection and profound thought, but by the study and natural progressof the common understanding.There are only three modes of proving the existence of a Deity, on thegrounds of speculative reason.All the paths conducting to this end begin either from determinateexperience and the peculiar constitution of the world of sense, andrise, according to the laws of causality, from it to the highest causeexisting apart from the world—or from a purely indeterminateexperience, that is, some empirical existence—or abstraction is made ofall experience, and the existence of a supreme cause is concluded fromà priori conceptions alone. The first is the physico-theologicalargument, the second the cosmological, the third the ontological. Morethere are not, and more there cannot be.I shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one path—the empirical—as onthe other—the transcendental, and that it stretches its wings in vain,to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculativethought. As regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments,it will be exactly the reverse of that in which reason, in the progressof its development, attains to them—the order in which they are placedabove. For it will be made manifest to the reader that, althoughexperience presents the occasion and the starting-point, it is thetranscendental idea of reason which guides it in its pilgrimage and isthe goal of all its struggles. I shall therefore begin with anexamination of the transcendental argument, and afterwards inquire whatadditional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the additionof the empirical element.Section IV. Of the Impossibility of an Ontological Proof of theExistence of GodIt is evident from what has been said that the conception of anabsolutely necessary being is a mere idea, the objective reality ofwhich is far from being established by the mere fact that it is a needof reason. On the contrary, this idea serves merely to indicate acertain unattainable perfection, and rather limits the operations than,by the presentation of new objects, extends the sphere of theunderstanding. But a strange anomaly meets us at the very threshold;for the inference from a given existence in general to an absolutelynecessary existence seems to be correct and unavoidable, while theconditions of the understanding refuse to aid us in forming anyconception of such a being.Philosophers have always talked of an absolutely necessary being, andhave nevertheless declined to take the trouble of conceivingwhether—and how—a being of this nature is even cogitable, not tomention that its existence is actually demonstrable. A verbaldefinition of the conception is certainly easy enough: it is somethingthe non-existence of which is impossible. But does this definitionthrow any light upon the conditions which render it impossible tocogitate the non-existence of a thing—conditions which we wish toascertain, that we may discover whether we think anything in theconception of such a being or not? For the mere fact that I throw away,by means of the word unconditioned, all the conditions which theunderstanding habitually requires in order to regard anything asnecessary, is very far from making clear whether by means of theconception of the unconditionally necessary I think of something, orreally of nothing at all.Nay, more, this chance-conception, now become so current, many haveendeavoured to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiriesregarding its intelligibility quite needless. Every geometricalproposition—a triangle has three angles—it was said, is absolutelynecessary; and thus people talked of an object which lay out of thesphere of our understanding as if it were perfectly plain what theconception of such a being meant.All the examples adduced have been drawn, without exception, fromjudgements, and not from things. But the unconditioned necessity of ajudgement does not form the absolute necessity of a thing. On thecontrary, the absolute necessity of a judgement is only a conditionednecessity of a thing, or of the predicate in a judgement. Theproposition above-mentioned does not enounce that three anglesnecessarily exist, but, upon condition that a triangle exists, threeangles must necessarily exist—in it. And thus this logical necessityhas been the source of the greatest delusions. Having formed an àpriori conception of a thing, the content of which was made to embraceexistence, we believed ourselves safe in concluding that, becauseexistence belongs necessarily to the object of the conception (that is,under the condition of my positing this thing as given), the existenceof the thing is also posited necessarily, and that it is thereforeabsolutely necessary—merely because its existence has been cogitated inthe conception.If, in an identical judgement, I annihilate the predicate in thought,and retain the subject, a contradiction is the result; and hence I say,the former belongs necessarily to the latter. But if I suppress bothsubject and predicate in thought, no contradiction arises; for there isnothing at all, and therefore no means of forming a contradiction. Tosuppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles,is self-contradictory; but to suppose the non-existence of bothtriangle and angles is perfectly admissible. And so is it with theconception of an absolutely necessary being. Annihilate its existencein thought, and you annihilate the thing itself with all itspredicates; how then can there be any room for contradiction?Externally, there is nothing to give rise to a contradiction, for athing cannot be necessary externally; nor internally, for, by theannihilation or suppression of the thing itself, its internalproperties are also annihilated. God is omnipotent—that is a necessaryjudgement. His omnipotence cannot be denied, if the existence of aDeity is posited—the existence, that is, of an infinite being, the twoconceptions being identical. But when you say, God does not exist,neither omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed; they must alldisappear with the subject, and in this judgement there cannot existthe least self-contradiction.You have thus seen that when the predicate of a judgement isannihilated in thought along with the subject, no internalcontradiction can arise, be the predicate what it may. There is nopossibility of evading the conclusion—you find yourselves compelled todeclare: There are certain subjects which cannot be annihilated inthought. But this is nothing more than saying: There exist subjectswhich are absolutely necessary—the very hypothesis which you are calledupon to establish. For I find myself unable to form the slightestconception of a thing which when annihilated in thought with all itspredicates, leaves behind a contradiction; and contradiction is theonly criterion of impossibility in the sphere of pure à prioriconceptions.Against these general considerations, the justice of which no one candispute, one argument is adduced, which is regarded as furnishing asatisfactory demonstration from the fact. It is affirmed that there isone and only one conception, in which the non-being or annihilation ofthe object is self-contradictory, and this is the conception of an ensrealissimum. It possesses, you say, all reality, and you feelyourselves justified in admitting the possibility of such a being.(This I am willing to grant for the present, although the existence ofa conception which is not self-contradictory is far from beingsufficient to prove the possibility of an object.)[67] Now the notionof all reality embraces in it that of existence; the notion ofexistence lies, therefore, in the conception of this possible thing. Ifthis thing is annihilated in thought, the internal possibility of thething is also annihilated, which is self-contradictory. [67] A conception is always possible, if it is not self-contradictory. This is the logical criterion of possibility, distinguishing the object of such a conception from the nihil negativum. But it may be, notwithstanding, an empty conception, unless the objective reality of this synthesis, but which it is generated, is demonstrated; and a proof of this kind must be based upon principles of possible experience, and not upon the principle of analysis or contradiction. This remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding, from the possibility of a conception—which is logical—the possibility of a thing—which is real.I answer: It is absurd to introduce—under whatever term disguised—intothe conception of a thing, which is to be cogitated solely in referenceto its possibility, the conception of its existence. If this isadmitted, you will have apparently gained the day, but in reality haveenounced nothing but a mere tautology. I ask, is the proposition, thisor that thing (which I am admitting to be possible) exists, ananalytical or a synthetical proposition? If the former, there is noaddition made to the subject of your thought by the affirmation of itsexistence; but then the conception in your minds is identical with thething itself, or you have supposed the existence of a thing to bepossible, and then inferred its existence from its internalpossibility—which is but a miserable tautology. The word reality in theconception of the thing, and the word existence in the conception ofthe predicate, will not help you out of the difficulty. For, supposingyou were to term all positing of a thing reality, you have therebyposited the thing with all its predicates in the conception of thesubject and assumed its actual existence, and this you merely repeat inthe predicate. But if you confess, as every reasonable person must,that every existential proposition is synthetical, how can it bemaintained that the predicate of existence cannot be denied withoutcontradiction?—a property which is the characteristic of analyticalpropositions, alone.I should have a reasonable hope of putting an end for ever to thissophistical mode of argumentation, by a strict definition of theconception of existence, did not my own experience teach me that theillusion arising from our confounding a logical with a real predicate(a predicate which aids in the determination of a thing) resists almostall the endeavours of explanation and illustration. A logical predicatemay be what you please, even the subject may be predicated of itself;for logic pays no regard to the content of a judgement. But thedetermination of a conception is a predicate, which adds to andenlarges the conception. It must not, therefore, be contained in theconception.Being is evidently not a real predicate, that is, a conception ofsomething which is added to the conception of some other thing. It ismerely the positing of a thing, or of certain determinations in it.Logically, it is merely the copula of a judgement. The proposition, Godis omnipotent, contains two conceptions, which have a certain object orcontent; the word is, is no additional predicate—it merely indicatesthe relation of the predicate to the subject. Now, if I take thesubject (God) with all its predicates (omnipotence being one), and say:God is, or, There is a God, I add no new predicate to the conception ofGod, I merely posit or affirm the existence of the subject with all itspredicates—I posit the object in relation to my conception. The contentof both is the same; and there is no addition made to the conception,which expresses merely the possibility of the object, by my cogitatingthe object—in the expression, it is—as absolutely given or existing.Thus the real contains no more than the possible. A hundred realdollars contain no more than a hundred possible dollars. For, as thelatter indicate the conception, and the former the object, on thesupposition that the content of the former was greater than that of thelatter, my conception would not be an expression of the whole object,and would consequently be an inadequate conception of it. But inreckoning my wealth there may be said to be more in a hundred realdollars than in a hundred possible dollars—that is, in the mereconception of them. For the real object—the dollars—is not analyticallycontained in my conception, but forms a synthetical addition to myconception (which is merely a determination of my mental state),although this objective reality—this existence—apart from myconceptions, does not in the least degree increase the aforesaidhundred dollars.By whatever and by whatever number of predicates—even to the completedetermination of it—I may cogitate a thing, I do not in the leastaugment the object of my conception by the addition of the statement:This thing exists. Otherwise, not exactly the same, but something morethan what was cogitated in my conception, would exist, and I could notaffirm that the exact object of my conception had real existence. If Icogitate a thing as containing all modes of reality except one, themode of reality which is absent is not added to the conception of thething by the affirmation that the thing exists; on the contrary, thething exists—if it exist at all—with the same defect as that cogitatedin its conception; otherwise not that which was cogitated, butsomething different, exists. Now, if I cogitate a being as the highestreality, without defect or imperfection, the question stillremains—whether this being exists or not? For, although no element iswanting in the possible real content of my conception, there is adefect in its relation to my mental state, that is, I am ignorantwhether the cognition of the object indicated by the conception ispossible à posteriori. And here the cause of the present difficultybecomes apparent. If the question regarded an object of sense merely,it would be impossible for me to confound the conception with theexistence of a thing. For the conception merely enables me to cogitatean object as according with the general conditions of experience; whilethe existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained inthe sphere of actual experience. At the same time, this connection withthe world of experience does not in the least augment the conception,although a possible perception has been added to the experience of themind. But if we cogitate existence by the pure category alone, it isnot to be wondered at, that we should find ourselves unable to presentany criterion sufficient to distinguish it from mere possibility.Whatever be the content of our conception of an object, it is necessaryto go beyond it, if we wish to predicate existence of the object. Inthe case of sensuous objects, this is attained by their connectionaccording to empirical laws with some one of my perceptions; but thereis no means of cognizing the existence of objects of pure thought,because it must be cognized completely à priori. But all our knowledgeof existence (be it immediately by perception, or by inferencesconnecting some object with a perception) belongs entirely to thesphere of experience—which is in perfect unity with itself; andalthough an existence out of this sphere cannot be absolutely declaredto be impossible, it is a hypothesis the truth of which we have nomeans of ascertaining.The notion of a Supreme Being is in many respects a highly useful idea;but for the very reason that it is an idea, it is incapable ofenlarging our cognition with regard to the existence of things. It isnot even sufficient to instruct us as to the possibility of a beingwhich we do not know to exist. The analytical criterion of possibility,which consists in the absence of contradiction in propositions, cannotbe denied it. But the connection of real properties in a thing is asynthesis of the possibility of which an à priori judgement cannot beformed, because these realities are not presented to us specifically;and even if this were to happen, a judgement would still be impossible,because the criterion of the possibility of synthetical cognitions mustbe sought for in the world of experience, to which the object of anidea cannot belong. And thus the celebrated Leibnitz has utterly failedin his attempt to establish upon à priori grounds the possibility ofthis sublime ideal being.The celebrated ontological or Cartesian argument for the existence of aSupreme Being is therefore insufficient; and we may as well hope toincrease our stock of knowledge by the aid of mere ideas, as themerchant to augment his wealth by the addition of noughts to his cashaccount.Section V. Of the Impossibility of a Cosmological Proof of theExistence of GodIt was by no means a natural course of proceeding, but, on thecontrary, an invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools, toattempt to draw from a mere idea a proof of the existence of an objectcorresponding to it. Such a course would never have been pursued, wereit not for that need of reason which requires it to suppose theexistence of a necessary being as a basis for the empirical regress,and that, as this necessity must be unconditioned and à priori, reasonis bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy, if possible,this requirement, and enable us to attain to the à priori cognition ofsuch a being. This conception was thought to be found in the idea of anens realissimum, and thus this idea was employed for the attainment ofa better defined knowledge of a necessary being, of the existence ofwhich we were convinced, or persuaded, on other grounds. Thus reasonwas seduced from her natural courage; and, instead of concluding withthe conception of an ens realissimum, an attempt was made to begin withit, for the purpose of inferring from it that idea of a necessaryexistence which it was in fact called in to complete. Thus arose thatunfortunate ontological argument, which neither satisfies the healthycommon sense of humanity, nor sustains the scientific examination ofthe philosopher.The cosmological proof, which we are about to examine, retains theconnection between absolute necessity and the highest reality; but,instead of reasoning from this highest reality to a necessaryexistence, like the preceding argument, it concludes from the givenunconditioned necessity of some being its unlimited reality. The trackit pursues, whether rational or sophistical, is at least natural, andnot only goes far to persuade the common understanding, but showsitself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect; while itcontains, at the same time, the outlines of all the arguments employedin natural theology—arguments which always have been, and still willbe, in use and authority. These, however adorned, and hid underwhatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment, are at bottomidentical with the arguments we are at present to discuss. This proof,termed by Leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi, I shall now laybefore the reader, and subject to a strict examination.It is framed in the following manner: If something exists, anabsolutely necessary being must likewise exist. Now I, at least, exist.Consequently, there exists an absolutely necessary being. The minorcontains an experience, the major reasons from a general experience tothe existence of a necessary being.[68] Thus this argument reallybegins at experience, and is not completely à priori, or ontological.The object of all possible experience being the world, it is called thecosmological proof. It contains no reference to any peculiar propertyof sensuous objects, by which this world of sense might bedistinguished from other possible worlds; and in this respect itdiffers from the physico-theological proof, which is based upon theconsideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world. [68] This inference is too well known to require more detailed discussion. It is based upon the spurious transcendental law of causality, that everything which is contingent has a cause, which, if itself contingent, must also have a cause; and so on, till the series of subordinated causes must end with an absolutely necessary cause, without which it would not possess completeness.The proof proceeds thus: A necessary being can be determined only inone way, that is, it can be determined by only one of all possibleopposed predicates; consequently, it must be completely determined inand by its conception. But there is only a single conception of a thingpossible, which completely determines the thing à priori: that is, theconception of the ens realissimum. It follows that the conception ofthe ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we cancogitate a necessary being. Consequently, a Supreme Being necessarilyexists.In this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophisticalpropositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it allher dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the mostextreme character. We shall postpone an investigation of this argumentfor the present, and confine ourselves to exposing the stratagem bywhich it imposes upon us an old argument in a new dress, and appeals tothe agreement of two witnesses, the one with the credentials of purereason, and the other with those of empiricism; while, in fact, it isonly the former who has changed his dress and voice, for the purpose ofpassing himself off for an additional witness. That it may possess asecure foundation, it bases its conclusions upon experience, and thusappears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument, whichplaces its confidence entirely in pure à priori conceptions. But thisexperience merely aids reason in making one step—to the existence of anecessary being. What the properties of this being are cannot belearned from experience; and therefore reason abandons it altogether,and pursues its inquiries in the sphere of pure conception, for thepurpose of discovering what the properties of an absolutely necessarybeing ought to be, that is, what among all possible things contain theconditions (requisita) of absolute necessity. Reason believes that ithas discovered these requisites in the conception of an ensrealissimum—and in it alone, and hence concludes: The ens realissimumis an absolutely necessary being. But it is evident that reason hashere presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectlyadequate to the conception of a being of absolute necessity, that is,that we may infer the existence of the latter from that of the former—aproposition which formed the basis of the ontological argument, andwhich is now employed in the support of the cosmological argument,contrary to the wish and professions of its inventors. For theexistence of an absolutely necessary being is given in conceptionsalone. But if I say: “The conception of the ens realissimum is aconception of this kind, and in fact the only conception which isadequate to our idea of a necessary being,” I am obliged to admit, thatthe latter may be inferred from the former. Thus it is properly theontological argument which figures in the cosmological, and constitutesthe whole strength of the latter; while the spurious basis ofexperience has been of no further use than to conduct us to theconception of absolute necessity, being utterly insufficient todemonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existenceor thing. For when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character, wemust abandon the sphere of experience, and rise to that of pureconceptions, which we examine with the purpose of discovering whetherany one contains the conditions of the possibility of an absolutelynecessary being. But if the possibility of such a being is thusdemonstrated, its existence is also proved; for we may then assertthat, of all possible beings there is one which possesses the attributeof necessity—in other words, this being possesses an absolutelynecessary existence.All illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they arepresented in the formal manner employed by the schools, which we nowproceed to do.If the proposition: “Every absolutely necessary being is likewise anens realissimum,” is correct (and it is this which constitutes thenervus probandi of the cosmological argument), it must, like allaffirmative judgements, be capable of conversion—the conversio peraccidens, at least. It follows, then, that some entia realissima areabsolutely necessary beings. But no ens realissimum is in any respectdifferent from another, and what is valid of some is valid of all. Inthis present case, therefore, I may employ simple conversion, and say:“Every ens realissimum is a necessary being.” But as this propositionis determined à priori by the conceptions contained in it, the mereconception of an ens realissimum must possess the additional attributeof absolute necessity. But this is exactly what was maintained in theontological argument, and not recognized by the cosmological, althoughit formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning.Thus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstratingthe existence of a Supreme Being, is not only, like the first, illusoryand inadequate, but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratioelenchi—professing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal, butbringing us back, after a short circuit, to the old path which we haddeserted at its call.I mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfectnest of dialectical assumptions, which transcendental criticism doesnot find it difficult to expose and to dissipate. I shall merelyenumerate these, leaving it to the reader, who must by this time bewell practised in such matters, to investigate the fallacies residingtherein.The following fallacies, for example, are discoverable in this mode ofproof: 1. The transcendental principle: “Everything that is contingentmust have a cause”—a principle without significance, except in thesensuous world. For the purely intellectual conception of thecontingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition, like that ofcausality, which is itself without significance or distinguishingcharacteristic except in the phenomenal world. But in the present caseit is employed to help us beyond the limits of its sphere. 2. “From theimpossibility of an infinite ascending series of causes in the world ofsense a first cause is inferred”; a conclusion which the principles ofthe employment of reason do not justify even in the sphere ofexperience, and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limitsof this sphere. 3. Reason allows itself to be satisfied uponinsufficient grounds, with regard to the completion of this series. Itremoves all conditions (without which, however, no conception ofNecessity can take place); and, as after this it is beyond our power toform any other conceptions, it accepts this as a completion of theconception it wishes to form of the series. 4. The logical possibilityof a conception of the total of reality (the criterion of thispossibility being the absence of contradiction) is confounded with thetranscendental, which requires a principle of the practicability ofsuch a synthesis—a principle which again refers us to the world ofexperience. And so on.The aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity ofproving the existence of a necessary being priori from mereconceptions—a proof which must be ontological, and of which we feelourselves quite incapable. With this purpose, we reason from an actualexistence—an experience in general, to an absolutely necessarycondition of that existence. It is in this case unnecessary todemonstrate its possibility. For after having proved that it exists,the question regarding its possibility is superfluous. Now, when wewish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being, we donot look out for some being the conception of which would enable us tocomprehend the necessity of its being—for if we could do this, anempirical presupposition would be unnecessary; no, we try to discovermerely the negative condition (conditio sine qua non), without which abeing would not be absolutely necessary. Now this would be perfectlyadmissible in every sort of reasoning, from a consequence to itsprinciple; but in the present case it unfortunately happens that thecondition of absolute necessity can be discovered in but a singlebeing, the conception of which must consequently contain all that isrequisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute necessity, andthus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity à priori. That is, itmust be possible to reason conversely, and say: The thing, to which theconception of the highest reality belongs, is absolutely necessary. Butif I cannot reason thus—and I cannot, unless I believe in thesufficiency of the ontological argument—I find insurmountable obstaclesin my new path, and am really no farther than the point from which Iset out. The conception of a Supreme Being satisfies all questions àpriori regarding the internal determinations of a thing, and is forthis reason an ideal without equal or parallel, the general conceptionof it indicating it as at the same time an ens individuum among allpossible things. But the conception does not satisfy the questionregarding its existence—which was the purpose of all our inquiries;and, although the existence of a necessary being were admitted, weshould find it impossible to answer the question: What of all things inthe world must be regarded as such?It is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an all-sufficientbeing—a cause of all possible effects—for the purpose of enablingreason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation withregard to phenomena. But to assert that such a being necessarilyexists, is no longer the modest enunciation of an admissiblehypothesis, but the boldest declaration of an apodeictic certainty; forthe cognition of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possessthat character.The aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either todiscover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolutenecessity, or a conception which shall contain that idea. If the one ispossible, so is the other; for reason recognizes that alone asabsolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception. But bothattempts are equally beyond our power—we find it impossible to satisfythe understanding upon this point, and as impossible to induce it toremain at rest in relation to this incapacity.Unconditioned necessity, which, as the ultimate support and stay of allexisting things, is an indispensable requirement of the mind, is anabyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay. Even theidea of eternity, terrible and sublime as it is, as depicted by Haller,does not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe andterror; for, although it measures the duration of things, it does notsupport them. We cannot bear, nor can we rid ourselves of the thoughtthat a being, which we regard as the greatest of all possibleexistences, should say to himself: I am from eternity to eternity;beside me there is nothing, except that which exists by my will; whencethen am I? Here all sinks away from under us; and the greatest, as thesmallest, perfection, hovers without stay or footing in presence of thespeculative reason, which finds it as easy to part with the one as withthe other.Many physical powers, which evidence their existence by their effects,are perfectly inscrutable in their nature; they elude all our powers ofobservation. The transcendental object which forms the basis ofphenomena, and, in connection with it, the reason why our sensibilitypossesses this rather than that particular kind of conditions, are andmust ever remain hidden from our mental vision; the fact is there, thereason of the fact we cannot see. But an ideal of pure reason cannot betermed mysterious or inscrutable, because the only credential of itsreality is the need of it felt by reason, for the purpose of givingcompleteness to the world of synthetical unity. An ideal is not evengiven as a cogitable object, and therefore cannot be inscrutable; onthe contrary, it must, as a mere idea, be based on the constitution ofreason itself, and on this account must be capable of explanation andsolution. For the very essence of reason consists in its ability togive an account, of all our conceptions, opinions, and assertions—uponobjective, or, when they happen to be illusory and fallacious, uponsubjective grounds.Detection and Explanation of the Dialectical Illusion in allTranscendental Arguments for the Existence of a Necessary Being.Both of the above arguments are transcendental; in other words, they donot proceed upon empirical principles. For, although the cosmologicalargument professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice ofreasoning, it did not ground its procedure upon the peculiarconstitution of experience, but upon pure principles of reason—inrelation to an existence given by empirical consciousness; utterlyabandoning its guidance, however, for the purpose of supporting itsassertions entirely upon pure conceptions. Now what is the cause, inthese transcendental arguments, of the dialectical, but natural,illusion, which connects the conceptions of necessity and supremereality, and hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea?What is the cause of this unavoidable step on the part of reason, ofadmitting that some one among all existing things must be necessary,while it falls back from the assertion of the existence of such a beingas from an abyss? And how does reason proceed to explain this anomalyto itself, and from the wavering condition of a timid and reluctantapprobation—always again withdrawn—arrive at a calm and settled insightinto its cause?It is something very remarkable that, on the supposition that somethingexists, I cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily.Upon this perfectly natural—but not on that account reliable—inferencedoes the cosmological argument rest. But, let me form any conceptionwhatever of a thing, I find that I cannot cogitate the existence of thething as absolutely necessary, and that nothing prevents me—be thething or being what it may—from cogitating its non-existence. I maythus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessarybasis, while I cannot cogitate any single or individual thing asnecessary. In other words, I can never complete the regress through theconditions of existence, without admitting the existence of a necessarybeing; but, on the other hand, I cannot make a commencement from thisbeing.If I must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis ofexisting things, and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individualthing as in itself necessary, the inevitable inference is thatnecessity and contingency are not properties of thingsthemselves—otherwise an internal contradiction would result; thatconsequently neither of these principles are objective, but merelysubjective principles of reason—the one requiring us to seek for anecessary ground for everything that exists, that is, to be satisfiedwith no other explanation than that which is complete à priori, theother forbidding us ever to hope for the attainment of thiscompleteness, that is, to regard no member of the empirical world asunconditioned. In this mode of viewing them, both principles, in theirpurely heuristic and regulative character, and as concerning merely theformal interest of reason, are quite consistent with each other. Theone says: “You must philosophize upon nature,” as if there existed anecessary primal basis of all existing things, solely for the purposeof introducing systematic unity into your knowledge, by pursuing anidea of this character—a foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to beultimate; while the other warns you to consider no individualdetermination, concerning the existence of things, as such an ultimatefoundation, that is, as absolutely necessary, but to keep the wayalways open for further progress in the deduction, and to treat everydetermination as determined by some other. But if all that we perceivemust be regarded as conditionally necessary, it is impossible thatanything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary.It follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary asout of and beyond the world, inasmuch as it is useful only as aprinciple of the highest possible unity in experience, and you cannotdiscover any such necessary existence in the would, the second rulerequiring you to regard all empirical causes of unity as themselvesdeduced.The philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature ascontingent; while matter was considered by them, in accordance with thejudgement of the common reason of mankind, as primal and necessary. Butif they had regarded matter, not relatively—as the substratum ofphenomena, but absolutely and in itself—as an independent existence,this idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared. Forthere is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence;on the contrary, it can annihilate it in thought, always and withoutself-contradiction. But in thought alone lay the idea of absolutenecessity. A regulative principle must, therefore, have been at thefoundation of this opinion. In fact, extension andimpenetrability—which together constitute our conception of matter—formthe supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena, and thisprinciple, in so far as it is empirically unconditioned, possesses theproperty of a regulative principle. But, as every determination ofmatter which constitutes what is real in it—and consequentlyimpenetrability—is an effect, which must have a cause, and is for thisreason always derived, the notion of matter cannot harmonize with theidea of a necessary being, in its character of the principle of allderived unity. For every one of its real properties, being derived,must be only conditionally necessary, and can therefore be annihilatedin thought; and thus the whole existence of matter can be soannihilated or suppressed. If this were not the case, we should havefound in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition ofunity—which is impossible, according to the second regulativeprinciple. It follows that matter, and, in general, all that forms partof the world of sense, cannot be a necessary primal being, nor even aprinciple of empirical unity, but that this being or principle musthave its place assigned without the world. And, in this way, we canproceed in perfect confidence to deduce the phenomena of the world andtheir existence from other phenomena, just as if there existed nonecessary being; and we can at the same time, strive without ceasingtowards the attainment of completeness for our deduction, just as ifsuch a being—the supreme condition of all existences—were presupposedby the mind.These remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal ofthe Supreme Being, far from being an enouncement of the existence of abeing in itself necessary, is nothing more than a regulative principleof reason, requiring us to regard all connection existing betweenphenomena as if it had its origin from an all-sufficient necessarycause, and basing upon this the rule of a systematic and necessaryunity in the explanation of phenomena. We cannot, at the same time,avoid regarding, by a transcendental subreptio, this formal principleas constitutive, and hypostatizing this unity. Precisely similar is thecase with our notion of space. Space is the primal condition of allforms, which are properly just so many different limitations of it; andthus, although it is merely a principle of sensibility, we cannot helpregarding it as an absolutely necessary and self-subsistent thing—as anobject given à priori in itself. In the same way, it is quite naturalthat, as the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as aprinciple for the empirical employment of reason, unless it is basedupon the idea of an ens realissimum, as the supreme cause, we shouldregard this idea as a real object, and this object, in its character ofsupreme condition, as absolutely necessary, and that in this way aregulative should be transformed into a constitutive principle. Thisinterchange becomes evident when I regard this supreme being, which,relatively to the world, was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary, asa thing per se. In this case, I find it impossible to represent thisnecessity in or by any conception, and it exists merely in my own mind,as the formal condition of thought, but not as a material andhypostatic condition of existence.Section VI. Of the Impossibility of a Physico-Theological ProofIf, then, neither a pure conception nor the general experience of anexisting being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of theexistence of the Deity, we can make the attempt by the only othermode—that of grounding our argument upon a determinate experience ofthe phenomena of the present world, their constitution and disposition,and discover whether we can thus attain to a sound conviction of theexistence of a Supreme Being. This argument we shall term thephysico-theological argument. If it is shown to be insufficient,speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of theexistence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea.It is evident from the remarks that have been made in the precedingsections, that an answer to this question will be far from beingdifficult or unconvincing. For how can any experience be adequate withan idea? The very essence of an idea consists in the fact that noexperience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it. Thetranscendental idea of a necessary and all-sufficient being is soimmeasurably great, so high above all that is empirical, which isalways conditioned, that we hope in vain to find materials in thesphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception, and in vainseek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned, whileexamples, nay, even guidance is denied us by the laws of empiricalsynthesis.If the Supreme Being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions,it must be a member of the empirical series, and, like the lowermembers which it precedes, have its origin in some higher member of theseries. If, on the other hand, we disengage it from the chain, andcogitate it as an intelligible being, apart from the series of naturalcauses—how shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter fromthe former? All laws respecting the regress from effects to causes, allsynthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possibleexperience and the objects of the sensuous world, and, apart from them,are without significance.The world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle oforder, variety, beauty, and conformity to ends, that whether we pursueour observations into the infinity of space in the one direction, orinto its illimitable divisions in the other, whether we regard theworld in its greatest or its least manifestations—even after we haveattained to the highest summit of knowledge which our weak minds canreach, we find that language in the presence of wonders soinconceivable has lost its force, and number its power to reckon, nay,even thought fails to conceive adequately, and our conception of thewhole dissolves into an astonishment without power of expression—allthe more eloquent that it is dumb. Everywhere around us we observe achain of causes and effects, of means and ends, of death and birth;and, as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which wefind it, we are constantly referred to some other thing, which itselfsuggests the same inquiry regarding its cause, and thus the universemust sink into the abyss of nothingness, unless we admit that, besidesthis infinite chain of contingencies, there exists something that isprimal and self-subsistent—something which, as the cause of thisphenomenal world, secures its continuance and preservation.This highest cause—what magnitude shall we attribute to it? Of thecontent of the world we are ignorant; still less can we estimate itsmagnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible. But thissupreme cause being a necessity of the human mind, what is there toprevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as toplace it above the sphere of all that is possible? This we can easilydo, although only by the aid of the faint outline of an abstractconception, by representing this being to ourselves as containing initself, as an individual substance, all possible perfection—aconception which satisfies that requirement of reason which demandsparsimony in principles, which is free from self-contradiction, whicheven contributes to the extension of the employment of reason inexperience, by means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order andsystem, and which in no respect conflicts with any law of experience.This argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect. It is theoldest, the clearest, and that most in conformity with the commonreason of humanity. It animates the study of nature, as it itselfderives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source. Itintroduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation couldnot of itself have discovered them, and extends our knowledge ofnature, by directing our attention to a unity, the principle of whichlies beyond nature. This knowledge of nature again reacts upon thisidea—its cause; and thus our belief in a divine author of the universerises to the power of an irresistible conviction.For these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob thisargument of the authority it has always enjoyed. The mind, unceasinglyelevated by these considerations, which, although empirical, are soremarkably powerful, and continually adding to their force, will notsuffer itself to be depressed by the doubts suggested by subtlespeculation; it tears itself out of this state of uncertainty, themoment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature and themajesty of the universe, and rises from height to height, fromcondition to condition, till it has elevated itself to the supreme andunconditioned author of all.But although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness andutility of this procedure, but have rather to commend and encourage it,we cannot approve of the claims which this argument advances todemonstrative certainty and to a reception upon its own merits, apartfrom favour or support by other arguments. Nor can it injure the causeof morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the arrogant sophist, andto teach him that modesty and moderation which are the properties of abelief that brings calm and content into the mind, without prescribingto it an unworthy subjection. I maintain, then, that thephysico-theological argument is insufficient of itself to prove theexistence of a Supreme Being, that it must entrust this to theontological argument—to which it serves merely as an introduction, andthat, consequently, this argument contains the only possible ground ofproof (possessed by speculative reason) for the existence of thisbeing.The chief momenta in the physico-theological argument are as follow: 1.We observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full ofpurpose, executed with great wisdom, and argument in whole of a contentindescribably various, and of an extent without limits. 2. Thisarrangement of means and ends is entirely foreign to the thingsexisting in the world—it belongs to them merely as a contingentattribute; in other words, the nature of different things could not ofitself, whatever means were employed, harmoniously tend towards certainpurposes, were they not chosen and directed for these purposes by arational and disposing principle, in accordance with certainfundamental ideas. 3. There exists, therefore, a sublime and wise cause(or several), which is not merely a blind, all-powerful nature,producing the beings and events which fill the world in unconsciousfecundity, but a free and intelligent cause of the world. 4. The unityof this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relationexisting between the parts of the world, as portions of an artisticedifice—an inference which all our observation favours, and allprinciples of analogy support.In the above argument, it is inferred from the analogy of certainproducts of nature with those of human art, when it compels Nature tobend herself to its purposes, as in the case of a house, a ship, or awatch, that the same kind of causality—namely, understanding andwill—resides in nature. It is also declared that the internalpossibility of this freely-acting nature (which is the source of allart, and perhaps also of human reason) is derivable from another andsuperhuman art—a conclusion which would perhaps be found incapable ofstanding the test of subtle transcendental criticism. But to neither ofthese opinions shall we at present object. We shall only remark that itmust be confessed that, if we are to discuss the subject of cause atall, we cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of theanalogy subsisting between nature and such products of design—thesebeing the only products whose causes and modes of organization arecompletely known to us. Reason would be unable to satisfy her ownrequirements, if she passed from a causality which she does know, toobscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does notknow.According to the physico-theological argument, the connection andharmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the formmerely, but not of the matter, that is, of the substance of the world.To establish the truth of the latter opinion, it would be necessary toprove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmonyand order, unless they were, even as regards their substance, theproduct of a supreme wisdom. But this would require very differentgrounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art.This proof can at most, therefore, demonstrate the existence of anarchitect of the world, whose efforts are limited by the capabilitiesof the material with which he works, but not of a creator of the world,to whom all things are subject. Thus this argument is utterlyinsufficient for the task before us—a demonstration of the existence ofan all-sufficient being. If we wish to prove the contingency of matter,we must have recourse to a transcendental argument, which thephysico-theological was constructed expressly to avoid.We infer, from the order and design visible in the universe, as adisposition of a thoroughly contingent character, the existence of acause proportionate thereto. The conception of this cause must containcertain determinate qualities, and it must therefore be regarded as theconception of a being which possesses all power, wisdom, and so on, inone word, all perfection—the conception, that is, of an all-sufficientbeing. For the predicates of very great, astonishing, or immeasurablepower and excellence, give us no determinate conception of the thing,nor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself. They merelyindicate the relation existing between the magnitude of the object andthe observer, who compares it with himself and with his own power ofcomprehension, and are mere expressions of praise and reverence, bywhich the object is either magnified, or the observing subjectdepreciated in relation to the object. Where we have to do with themagnitude (of the perfection) of a thing, we can discover nodeterminate conception, except that which comprehends all possibleperfection or completeness, and it is only the total (omnitudo) ofreality which is completely determined in and through its conceptionalone.Now it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declarethat he has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude ofthe world he contemplates bears (in its extent as well as in itscontent) to omnipotence, into that of the order and design in the worldto the highest wisdom, and that of the unity of the world to theabsolute unity of a Supreme Being. Physico-theology is thereforeincapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause ofthe world, and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theology—atheology which is itself to be the basis of religion.The attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on thepath of empiricism. And yet this is the path pursued in thephysico-theological argument. What means shall we employ to bridge theabyss?After elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power,wisdom, and other attributes of the author of the world, and finding wecan advance no further, we leave the argument on empirical grounds, andproceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order andconformity to aims that are observable in it. From this contingency weinfer, by the help of transcendental conceptions alone, the existenceof something absolutely necessary; and, still advancing, proceed fromthe conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to thecompletely determined or determining conception thereof—the conceptionof an all-embracing reality. Thus the physico-theological, failing inits undertaking, recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmologicalargument; and, as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise,it executes its design solely by the aid of pure reason, although it atfirst professed to have no connection with this faculty and to base itsentire procedure upon experience alone.The physico-theologians have therefore no reason to regard with suchcontempt the transcendental mode of argument, and to look down upon it,with the conceit of clear-sighted observers of nature, as thebrain-cobweb of obscure speculatists. For, if they reflect upon andexamine their own arguments, they will find that, after following forsome time the path of nature and experience, and discovering themselvesno nearer their object, they suddenly leave this path and pass into theregion of pure possibility, where they hope to reach upon the wings ofideas what had eluded all their empirical investigations. Gaining, asthey think, a firm footing after this immense leap, they extend theirdeterminate conception—into the possession of which they have come,they know not how—over the whole sphere of creation, and explain theirideal, which is entirely a product of pure reason, by illustrationsdrawn from experience—though in a degree miserably unworthy of thegrandeur of the object, while they refuse to acknowledge that they havearrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road fromthat of experience.Thus the physico-theological is based upon the cosmological, and thisupon the ontological proof of the existence of a Supreme Being; and asbesides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason,the ontological proof, on the ground of pure conceptions of reason, isthe only possible one, if any proof of a proposition so fartranscending the empirical exercise of the understanding is possible atall.Section VII. Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principlesof ReasonIf by the term theology I understand the cognition of a primal being,that cognition is based either upon reason alone (theologia rationalis)or upon revelation (theologia revelata). The former cogitates itsobject either by means of pure transcendental conceptions, as an ensoriginarium, realissimum, ens entium, and is termed transcendentaltheology; or, by means of a conception derived from the nature of ourown mind, as a supreme intelligence, and must then be entitled naturaltheology. The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone,is termed a deist; he who acknowledges the possibility of a naturaltheology also, a theist. The former admits that we can cognize by purereason alone the existence of a Supreme Being, but at the same timemaintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental,and that all we can say of it is that it possesses all reality, withoutbeing able to define it more closely. The second asserts that reason iscapable of presenting us, from the analogy with nature, with a moredefinite conception of this being, and that its operations, as thecause of all things, are the results of intelligence and free will. Theformer regards the Supreme Being as the cause of the world—whether bythe necessity of his nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined;the latter considers this being as the author of the world.Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of aSupreme Being from a general experience, without any closer referenceto the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it iscalled cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of sucha being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, andis then termed ontotheology.Natural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an authorof the world, from the constitution of, the order and unity observablein, the world, in which two modes of causality must be admitted toexist—those of nature and freedom. Thus it rises from this world to asupreme intelligence, either as the principle of all natural, or of allmoral order and perfection. In the former case it is termedphysico-theology, in the latter, ethical or moral-theology.[69] [69] Not theological ethics; for this science contains ethical laws, which presuppose the existence of a Supreme Governor of the world; while moral-theology, on the contrary, is the expression of a conviction of the existence of a Supreme Being, founded upon ethical laws.As we are wont to understand by the term God not merely an eternalnature, the operations of which are insensate and blind, but a SupremeBeing, who is the free and intelligent author of all things, and as itis this latter view alone that can be of interest to humanity, wemight, in strict rigour, deny to the deist any belief in God at all,and regard him merely as a maintainer of the existence of a primalbeing or thing—the supreme cause of all other things. But, as no oneought to be blamed, merely because he does not feel himself justifiedin maintaining a certain opinion, as if he altogether denied its truthand asserted the opposite, it is more correct—as it is less harsh—tosay, the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God (summaintelligentia). We shall now proceed to investigate the sources of allthese attempts of reason to establish the existence of a Supreme Being.It may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge orcognition as knowledge of that which is, and practical knowledge asknowledge of that which ought to be. In this view, the theoreticalemployment of reason is that by which I cognize à priori (as necessary)that something is, while the practical is that by which I cognize àpriori what ought to happen. Now, if it is an indubitably certain,though at the same time an entirely conditioned truth, that somethingis, or ought to happen, either a certain determinate condition of thistruth is absolutely necessary, or such a condition may be arbitrarilypresupposed. In the former case the condition is postulated (perthesin), in the latter supposed (per hypothesin). There are certainpractical laws—those of morality—which are absolutely necessary. Now,if these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being, asthe condition of the possibility of their obligatory power, this beingmust be postulated, because the conditioned, from which we reason tothis determinate condition, is itself cognized à priori as absolutelynecessary. We shall at some future time show that the moral laws notmerely presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being, but also, asthemselves absolutely necessary in a different relation, demand orpostulate it—although only from a practical point of view. Thediscussion of this argument we postpone for the present.When the question relates merely to that which is, not to that whichought to be, the conditioned which is presented in experience is alwayscogitated as contingent. For this reason its condition cannot beregarded as absolutely necessary, but merely as relatively necessary,or rather as needful; the condition is in itself and à priori a merearbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition, by reason, of theconditioned. If, then, we are to possess a theoretical cognition of theabsolute necessity of a thing, we cannot attain to this cognitionotherwise than à priori by means of conceptions; while it is impossiblein this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears anyrelation to an existence given in experience.Theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object orcertain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot bediscovered by means of experience. It is opposed to the cognition ofnature, which concerns only those objects or predicates which can bepresented in a possible experience.The principle that everything which happens (the empiricallycontingent) must have a cause, is a principle of the cognition ofnature, but not of speculative cognition. For, if we change it into anabstract principle, and deprive it of its reference to experience andthe empirical, we shall find that it cannot with justice be regardedany longer as a synthetical proposition, and that it is impossible todiscover any mode of transition from that which exists to somethingentirely different—termed cause. Nay, more, the conception of a causelikewise that of the contingent—loses, in this speculative mode ofemploying it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaningare comprehensible from experience alone.When from the existence of the universe and the things in it theexistence of a cause of the universe is inferred, reason is proceedingnot in the natural, but in the speculative method. For the principle ofthe former enounces, not that things themselves or substances, but onlythat which happens or their states—as empirically contingent, have acause: the assertion that the existence of substance itself iscontingent is not justified by experience, it is the assertion of areason employing its principles in a speculative manner. If, again, Iinfer from the form of the universe, from the way in which all thingsare connected and act and react upon each other, the existence of acause entirely distinct from the universe—this would again be ajudgement of purely speculative reason; because the object in thiscase—the cause—can never be an object of possible experience. In boththese cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in thefield of experience—useless and even meaningless beyond this region,would be diverted from its proper destination.Now I maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology bythe aid of speculation alone are fruitless, that the principles ofreason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theologicaltruths, and, consequently, that a rational theology can have noexistence, unless it is founded upon the laws of morality. For allsynthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanentin experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessitatestheir being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding isquite incapable. If the empirical law of causality is to conduct us toa Supreme Being, this being must belong to the chain of empiricalobjects—in which case it would be, like all phenomena, itselfconditioned. If the possibility of passing the limits of experience beadmitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect toits cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?Certainly not the conception of a Supreme Being, because experiencenever presents us with the greatest of all possible effects, and it isonly an effect of this character that could witness to the existence ofa corresponding cause. If, for the purpose of fully satisfying therequirements of Reason, we recognize her right to assert the existenceof a perfect and absolutely necessary being, this can be admitted onlyfrom favour, and cannot be regarded as the result of irresistibledemonstration. The physico-theological proof may add weight toothers—if other proofs there are—by connecting speculation withexperience; but in itself it rather prepares the mind for theologicalcognition, and gives it a right and natural direction, than establishesa sure foundation for theology.It is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only oftranscendental answers—those presented à priori by pure conceptionswithout the least empirical admixture. But the question in the presentcase is evidently synthetical—it aims at the extension of our cognitionbeyond the bounds of experience—it requires an assurance respecting theexistence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds, to whichno experience can ever be adequate. Now it has been abundantly provedthat all à priori synthetical cognition is possible only as theexpression of the formal conditions of a possible experience; and thatthe validity of all principles depends upon their immanence in thefield of experience, that is, their relation to objects of empiricalcognition or phenomena. Thus all transcendental procedure in referenceto speculative theology is without result.If any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of ouranalytic to losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and timehonoured arguments, he at least cannot decline answering thequestion—how he can pass the limits of all possible experience by thehelp of mere ideas. If he talks of new arguments, or of improvementsupon old arguments, I request him to spare me. There is certainly nogreat choice in this sphere of discussion, as all speculative argumentsmust at last look for support to the ontological, and I have,therefore, very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of thedogmatical defenders of a non-sensuous reason. Without looking uponmyself as a remarkably combative person, I shall not decline thechallenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of everyattempt of speculative theology. And yet the hope of better fortunenever deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode ofprocedure. I shall, therefore, restrict myself to the simple andequitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate, from the natureof the human mind as well as from that of the other sources ofknowledge, how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely àpriori, and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us, andno means exist of guaranteeing the objective reality of ourconceptions. In whatever way the understanding may have attained to aconception, the existence of the object of the conception cannot bediscovered in it by analysis, because the cognition of the existence ofthe object depends upon the object’s being posited and given in itselfapart from the conception. But it is utterly impossible to go beyondour conception, without the aid of experience—which presents to themind nothing but phenomena, or to attain by the help of mereconceptions to a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects orsupernatural beings.But although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient todemonstrate the existence of a Supreme Being, it is of the highestutility in correcting our conception of this being—on the suppositionthat we can attain to the cognition of it by some other means—in makingit consistent with itself and with all other conceptions ofintelligible objects, clearing it from all that is incompatible withthe conception of an ens summun, and eliminating from it alllimitations or admixtures of empirical elements.Transcendental theology is still therefore, notwithstanding itsobjective insufficiency, of importance in a negative respect; it isuseful as a test of the procedure of reason when engaged with pureideas, no other than a transcendental standard being in this caseadmissible. For if, from a practical point of view, the hypothesis of aSupreme and All-sufficient Being is to maintain its validity withoutopposition, it must be of the highest importance to define thisconception in a correct and rigorous manner—as the transcendentalconception of a necessary being, to eliminate all phenomenal elements(anthropomorphism in its most extended signification), and at the sametime to overflow all contradictory assertions—be they atheistic,deistic, or anthropomorphic. This is of course very easy; as the samearguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirmthe existence of a Supreme Being must be alike sufficient to prove theinvalidity of its denial. For it is impossible to gain from the purespeculation of reason demonstration that there exists no Supreme Being,as the ground of all that exists, or that this being possesses none ofthose properties which we regard as analogical with the dynamicalqualities of a thinking being, or that, as the anthropomorphists wouldhave us believe, it is subject to all the limitations which sensibilityimposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world ofexperience.A Supreme Being is, therefore, for the speculative reason, a mereideal, though a faultless one—a conception which perfects and crownsthe system of human cognition, but the objective reality of which canneither be proved nor disproved by pure reason. If this defect is eversupplied by a moral theology, the problematic transcendental theologywhich has preceded, will have been at least serviceable asdemonstrating the mental necessity existing for the conception, by thecomplete determination of it which it has furnished, and the ceaselesstesting of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense, and notalways in harmony with its own ideas. The attributes of necessity,infinitude, unity, existence apart from the world (and not as a worldsoul), eternity (free from conditions of time), omnipresence (free fromconditions of space), omnipotence, and others, are pure transcendentalpredicates; and thus the accurate conception of a Supreme Being, whichevery theology requires, is furnished by transcendental theology alone.APPENDIX. Of the Regulative Employment of the Ideas of Pure ReasonThe result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not onlyconfirms the truth of what we have already proved in our TranscendentalAnalytic, namely, that all inferences which would lead us beyond thelimits of experience are fallacious and groundless, but it at the sametime teaches us this important lesson, that human reason has a naturalinclination to overstep these limits, and that transcendental ideas areas much the natural property of the reason as categories are of theunderstanding. There exists this difference, however, that while thecategories never mislead us, outward objects being always in perfectharmony therewith, ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions, theseverest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from thefallacies which they induce.Whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be inharmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers,when once we have discovered their true direction and aim. We areentitled to suppose, therefore, that there exists a mode of employingtranscendental ideas which is proper and immanent; although, when wemistake their meaning, and regard them as conceptions of actual things,their mode of application is transcendent and delusive. For it is notthe idea itself, but only the employment of the idea in relation topossible experience, that is transcendent or immanent. An idea isemployed transcendently, when it is applied to an object falselybelieved to be adequate with and to correspond to it; imminently, whenit is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in thesphere of experience. Thus all errors of subreptio—of misapplication,are to be ascribed to defects of judgement, and not to understanding orreason.Reason never has an immediate relation to an object; it relatesimmediately to the understanding alone. It is only through theunderstanding that it can be employed in the field of experience. Itdoes not form conceptions of objects, it merely arranges them and givesto them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphereof their application has been extended as widely as possible. Reasonavails itself of the conception of the understanding for the solepurpose of producing totality in the different series. This totalitythe understanding does not concern itself with; its only occupation isthe connection of experiences, by which series of conditions inaccordance with conceptions are established. The object of reason is,therefore, the understanding and its proper destination. As the latterbrings unity into the diversity of objects by means of its conceptions,so the former brings unity into the diversity of conceptions by meansof ideas; as it sets the final aim of a collective unity to theoperations of the understanding, which without this occupies itselfwith a distributive unity alone.I accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employedas constitutive ideas, that they cannot be conceptions of objects, andthat, when thus considered, they assume a fallacious and dialecticalcharacter. But, on the other hand, they are capable of an admirable andindispensably necessary application to objects—as regulative ideas,directing the understanding to a certain aim, the guiding lines towardswhich all its laws follow, and in which they all meet in one point.This point—though a mere idea (focus imaginarius), that is, not a pointfrom which the conceptions of the understanding do really proceed, forit lies beyond the sphere of possible experience—serves,notwithstanding, to give to these conceptions the greatest possibleunity combined with the greatest possible extension. Hence arises thenatural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceedfrom an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition,just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it. But thisillusion—which we may hinder from imposing upon us—is necessary andunavoidable, if we desire to see, not only those objects which liebefore us, but those which are at a great distance behind us; that isto say, when, in the present case, we direct the aims of theunderstanding, beyond every given experience, towards an extension asgreat as can possibly be attained.If we review our cognitions in their entire extent, we shall find thatthe peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system, thatis to say, to give them connection according to a principle. This unitypresupposes an idea—the idea of the form of a whole (of cognition),preceding the determinate cognition of the parts, and containing theconditions which determine à priori to every part its place andrelation to the other parts of the whole system. This idea,accordingly, demands complete unity in the cognition of theunderstanding—not the unity of a contingent aggregate, but that of asystem connected according to necessary laws. It cannot be affirmedwith propriety that this idea is a conception of an object; it ismerely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions ofobjects, in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as arule. Such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature; on thecontrary, we employ them for the interrogation and investigation ofnature, and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is notadequate to them. We admit that such a thing as pure earth, pure water,or pure air, is not to be discovered. And yet we require theseconceptions (which have their origin in the reason, so far as regardstheir absolute purity and completeness) for the purpose of determiningthe share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon.Thus the different kinds of matter are all referred to earths, as mereweight; to salts and inflammable bodies, as pure force; and finally, towater and air, as the vehicula of the former, or the machines employedby them in their operations—for the purpose of explaining the chemicalaction and reaction of bodies in accordance with the idea of amechanism. For, although not actually so expressed, the influence ofsuch ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of naturalphilosophers.If reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general,and if the general be certain in se and given, it is only necessarythat the judgement should subsume the particular under the general, theparticular being thus necessarily determined. I shall term this thedemonstrative or apodeictic employment of reason. If, however, thegeneral is admitted as problematical only, and is a mere idea, theparticular case is certain, but the universality of the rule whichapplies to this particular case remains a problem. Several particularcases, the certainty of which is beyond doubt, are then taken andexamined, for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicableto them; and if it appears that all the particular cases which can becollected follow from the rule, its universality is inferred, and atthe same time, all the causes which have not, or cannot be presented toour observation, are concluded to be of the same character with thosewhich we have observed. This I shall term the hypothetical employmentof the reason.The hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed asproblematical conceptions is properly not constitutive. That is to say,if we consider the subject strictly, the truth of the rule, which hasbeen employed as an hypothesis, does not follow from the use that ismade of it by reason. For how can we know all the possible cases thatmay arise? some of which may, however, prove exceptions to theuniversality of the rule. This employment of reason is merelyregulative, and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into theaggregate of our particular cognitions, and thereby the approximatingof the rule to universality.The object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore thesystematic unity of cognitions; and this unity is the criterion of thetruth of a rule. On the other hand, this systematic unity—as a mereidea—is in fact merely a unity projected, not to be regarded as given,but only in the light of a problem—a problem which serves, however, asa principle for the various and particular exercise of theunderstanding in experience, directs it with regard to those caseswhich are not presented to our observation, and introduces harmony andconsistency into all its operations.All that we can be certain of from the above considerations is thatthis systematic unity is a logical principle, whose aim is to assistthe understanding, where it cannot of itself attain to rules, by meansof ideas, to bring all these various rules under one principle, andthus to ensure the most complete consistency and connection that can beattained. But the assertion that objects and the understanding by whichthey are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematicunity, that this may be postulated à priori, without any reference tothe interest of reason, and that we are justified in declaring allpossible cognitions—empirical and others—to possess systematic unity,and to be subject to general principles from which, notwithstandingtheir various character, they are all derivable such an assertion canbe founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason, which wouldrender this systematic unity not subjectively and logically—in itscharacter of a method, but objectively necessary.We shall illustrate this by an example. The conceptions of theunderstanding make us acquainted, among many other kinds of unity, withthat of the causality of a substance, which is termed power. Thedifferent phenomenal manifestations of the same substance appear atfirst view to be so very dissimilar that we are inclined to assume theexistence of just as many different powers as there are differenteffects—as, in the case of the human mind, we have feeling,consciousness, imagination, memory, wit, analysis, pleasure, desire andso on. Now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce thesedifferences to as small a number as possible, by comparing them anddiscovering the hidden identity which exists. We must inquire, forexample, whether or not imagination (connected with consciousness),memory, wit, and analysis are not merely different forms ofunderstanding and reason. The idea of a fundamental power, theexistence of which no effort of logic can assure us of, is the problemto be solved, for the systematic representation of the existing varietyof powers. The logical principle of reason requires us to produce asgreat a unity as is possible in the system of our cognitions; and themore the phenomena of this and the other power are found to beidentical, the more probable does it become, that they are nothing butdifferent manifestations of one and the same power, which may becalled, relatively speaking, a fundamental power. And so with othercases.These relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with eachother, to discover, if possible, the one radical and absolutelyfundamental power of which they are but the manifestations. But thisunity is purely hypothetical. It is not maintained, that this unitydoes really exist, but that we must, in the interest of reason, thatis, for the establishment of principles for the various rules presentedby experience, try to discover and introduce it, so far as ispracticable, into the sphere of our cognitions.But the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us tobelieve that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical, butthat it possesses objective reality, and thus the systematic unity ofthe various powers or forces in a substance is demanded by theunderstanding and erected into an apodeictic or necessary principle.For, without having attempted to discover the unity of the variouspowers existing in nature, nay, even after all our attempts havefailed, we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist, and may be,sooner or later, discovered. And this reason does, not only, as in thecase above adduced, with regard to the unity of substance, but wheremany substances, although all to a certain extent homogeneous, arediscoverable, as in the case of matter in general. Here also doesreason presuppose the existence of the systematic unity of variouspowers—inasmuch as particular laws of nature are subordinate to generallaws; and parsimony in principles is not merely an economical principleof reason, but an essential law of nature.We cannot understand, in fact, how a logical principle of unity can ofright exist, unless we presuppose a transcendental principle, by whichsuch a systematic unit—as a property of objects themselves—is regardedas necessary à priori. For with what right can reason, in its logicalexercise, require us to regard the variety of forces which naturedisplays, as in effect a disguised unity, and to deduce them from onefundamental force or power, when she is free to admit that it is justas possible that all forces should be different in kind, and that asystematic unity is not conformable to the design of nature? In thisview of the case, reason would be proceeding in direct opposition toher own destination, by setting as an aim an idea which entirelyconflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature. Neither can weassert that reason has previously inferred this unity from thecontingent nature of phenomena. For the law of reason which requires usto seek for this unity is a necessary law, inasmuch as without it weshould not possess a faculty of reason, nor without reason a consistentand self-accordant mode of employing the understanding, nor, in theabsence of this, any proper and sufficient criterion of empiricaltruth. In relation to this criterion, therefore, we must suppose theidea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validityand necessity.We find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different formsin the principles of philosophers, although they have neitherrecognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence. That thediversities of individual things do not exclude identity of species,that the various species must be considered as merely differentdeterminations of a few genera, and these again as divisions of stillhigher races, and so on—that, accordingly, a certain systematic unityof all possible empirical conceptions, in so far as they can be deducedfrom higher and more general conceptions, must be sought for, is ascholastic maxim or logical principle, without which reason could notbe employed by us. For we can infer the particular from the general,only in so far as general properties of things constitute thefoundation upon which the particular rest.That the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers inthe well-known scholastic maxim, which forbids us unnecessarily toaugment the number of entities or principles (entia praeternecessitatem non esse multiplicanda). This maxim asserts that natureherself assists in the establishment of this unity of reason, and thatthe seemingly infinite diversity of phenomena should not deter us fromthe expectation of discovering beneath this diversity a unity offundamental properties, of which the aforesaid variety is but a more orless determined form. This unity, although a mere idea, thinkers havefound it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it.It was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce allsalts to two main genera—acids and alkalis; and they regard thisdifference as itself a mere variety, or different manifestation of oneand the same fundamental material. The different kinds of earths(stones and even metals) chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three,and afterwards to two; but still, not content with this advance, theycannot but think that behind these diversities there lurks but onegenus—nay, that even salts and earths have a common principle. It mightbe conjectured that this is merely an economical plan of reason, forthe purpose of sparing itself trouble, and an attempt of a purelyhypothetical character, which, when successful, gives an appearance ofprobability to the principle of explanation employed by the reason. Buta selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from theidea, according to which every one presupposes that this unity is inaccordance with the laws of nature, and that reason does not in thiscase request, but requires, although we are quite unable to determinethe proper limits of this unity.If the diversity existing in phenomena—a diversity not of form (for inthis they may be similar) but of content—were so great that thesubtlest human reason could never by comparison discover in them theleast similarity (which is not impossible), in this case the logicallaw of genera would be without foundation, the conception of a genus,nay, all general conceptions would be impossible, and the faculty ofthe understanding, the exercise of which is restricted to the world ofconceptions, could not exist. The logical principle of genera,accordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objectspresented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle. Inaccordance with this principle, homogeneity is necessarily presupposedin the variety of phenomena (although we are unable to determine àpriori the degree of this homogeneity), because without it no empiricalconceptions, and consequently no experience, would be possible.The logical principle of genera, which demands identity in phenomena,is balanced by another principle—that of species, which requiresvariety and diversity in things, notwithstanding their accordance inthe same genus, and directs the understanding to attend to the one noless than to the other. This principle (of the faculty of distinction)acts as a check upon the reason and reason exhibits in this respect adouble and conflicting interest—on the one hand, the interest in theextent (the interest of generality) in relation to genera; on theother, that of the content (the interest of individuality) in relationto the variety of species. In the former case, the understandingcogitates more under its conceptions, in the latter it cogitates morein them. This distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits ofthought peculiar to natural philosophers, some of whom—the remarkablyspeculative heads—may be said to be hostile to heterogeneity inphenomena, and have their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera,while others—with a strong empirical tendency—aim unceasingly at theanalysis of phenomena, and almost destroy in us the hope of ever beingable to estimate the character of these according to generalprinciples.The latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle,the aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions. Thisprinciple authorizes me, beginning at the genus, to descend to thevarious and diverse contained under it; and in this way extension, asin the former case unity, is assured to the system. For if we merelyexamine the sphere of the conception which indicates a genus, we cannotdiscover how far it is possible to proceed in the division of thatsphere; just as it is impossible, from the consideration of the spaceoccupied by matter, to determine how far we can proceed in the divisionof it. Hence every genus must contain different species, and theseagain different subspecies; and as each of the latter must itselfcontain a sphere (must be of a certain extent, as a conceptuscommunis), reason demands that no species or sub-species is to beconsidered as the lowest possible. For a species or sub-species, beingalways a conception, which contains only what is common to a number ofdifferent things, does not completely determine any individual thing,or relate immediately to it, and must consequently contain otherconceptions, that is, other sub-species under it. This law ofspecification may be thus expressed: entium varietates non temere suntminuendae.But it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be withoutsense or application, were it not based upon a transcendental law ofspecification, which certainly does not require that the differencesexisting phenomena should be infinite in number, for the logicalprinciple, which merely maintains the indeterminateness of the logicalsphere of a conception, in relation to its possible division, does notauthorize this statement; while it does impose upon the understandingthe duty of searching for subspecies to every species, and minordifferences in every difference. For, were there no lower conceptions,neither could there be any higher. Now the understanding cognizes onlyby means of conceptions; consequently, how far soever it may proceed indivision, never by mere intuition, but always by lower and lowerconceptions. The cognition of phenomena in their complete determination(which is possible only by means of the understanding) requires anunceasingly continued specification of conceptions, and a progressionto ever smaller differences, of which abstraction had been made in theconception of the species, and still more in that of the genus.This law of specification cannot be deduced from experience; it cannever present us with a principle of so universal an application.Empirical specification very soon stops in its distinction ofdiversities, and requires the guidance of the transcendental law, as aprinciple of the reason—a law which imposes on us the necessity ofnever ceasing in our search for differences, even although these maynot present themselves to the senses. That absorbent earths are ofdifferent kinds could only be discovered by obeying the anticipatorylaw of reason, which imposes upon the understanding the task ofdiscovering the differences existing between these earths, and supposesthat nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate. Thefaculty of the understanding belongs to us just as much under thepresupposition of differences in the objects of nature, as under thecondition that these objects are homogeneous, because we could notpossess conceptions, nor make any use of our understanding, were notthe phenomena included under these conceptions in some respectsdissimilar, as well as similar, in their character.Reason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operationsof this faculty: 1. By the principle of the homogeneity of the diversein higher genera; 2. By the principle of the variety of the homogeneousin lower species; and, to complete the systematic unity, it adds, 3. Alaw of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuoustransition from one species to every other by the gradual increase ofdiversity. We may term these the principles of the homogeneity, thespecification, and the continuity of forms. The latter results from theunion of the two former, inasmuch as we regard the systematicconnection as complete in thought, in the ascent to higher genera, aswell as in the descent to lower species. For all diversities must berelated to each other, as they all spring from one highest genus,descending through the different gradations of a more and more extendeddetermination.We may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logicalprinciples in the following manner. Every conception may be regarded asa point, which, as the standpoint of a spectator, has a certainhorizon, which may be said to enclose a number of things that may beviewed, so to speak, from that centre. Within this horizon there mustbe an infinite number of other points, each of which has its ownhorizon, smaller and more circumscribed; in other words, every speciescontains sub-species, according to the principle of specification, andthe logical horizon consists of smaller horizons (subspecies), but notof points (individuals), which possess no extent. But differenthorizons or genera, which include under them so many conceptions, mayhave one common horizon, from which, as from a mid-point, they may besurveyed; and we may proceed thus, till we arrive at the highest genus,or universal and true horizon, which is determined by the highestconception, and which contains under itself all differences andvarieties, as genera, species, and subspecies.To this highest standpoint I am conducted by the law of homogeneity, asto all lower and more variously-determined conceptions by the law ofspecification. Now as in this way there exists no void in the wholeextent of all possible conceptions, and as out of the sphere of thesethe mind can discover nothing, there arises from the presupposition ofthe universal horizon above mentioned, and its complete division, theprinciple: Non datur vacuum formarum. This principle asserts that thereare not different primitive and highest genera, which stand isolated,so to speak, from each other, but all the various genera are meredivisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus; and hencefollows immediately the principle: Datur continuum formarum. Thisprinciple indicates that all differences of species limit each other,and do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus, butonly through smaller degrees of the difference between the one speciesand the other. In one word, there are no species or sub-species which(in the view of reason) are the nearest possible to each other;intermediate species or sub-species being always possible, thedifference of which from each of the former is always smaller than thedifference existing between these.The first law, therefore, directs us to avoid the notion that thereexist different primal genera, and enounces the fact of perfecthomogeneity; the second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity andprescribes the distinction of sub-species, before proceeding to applyour general conceptions to individuals. The third unites both theformer, by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in themost various diversity, by means of the gradual transition from onespecies to another. Thus it indicates a relationship between thedifferent branches or species, in so far as they all spring from thesame stem.But this logical law of the continuum specierum (formarum logicarum)presupposes a transcendental principle (lex continui in natura),without which the understanding might be led into error, by followingthe guidance of the former, and thus perhaps pursuing a path contraryto that prescribed by nature. This law must, consequently, be basedupon pure transcendental, and not upon empirical, considerations. For,in the latter case, it would come later than the system; whereas it isreally itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition ofnature. These principles are not mere hypotheses employed for thepurpose of experimenting upon nature; although when any such connectionis discovered, it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypotheticalunity as valid in the sphere of nature—and thus they are in thisrespect not without their use. But we go farther, and maintain that itis manifest that these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes,variety in effects, and affinity in phenomena, are in accordance bothwith reason and nature, and that they are not mere methods or plansdevised for the purpose of assisting us in our observation of theexternal world.But it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, to whichno adequate object can be discovered in experience. And this for tworeasons. First, because the species in nature are really divided, andhence form quanta discreta; and, if the gradual progression throughtheir affinity were continuous, the intermediate members lying betweentwo given species must be infinite in number, which is impossible.Secondly, because we cannot make any determinate empirical use of thislaw, inasmuch as it does not present us with any criterion of affinitywhich could aid us in determining how far we ought to pursue thegraduation of differences: it merely contains a general indication thatit is our duty to seek for and, if possible, to discover them.When we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the orderconformable to their employment in experience, they will stand thus:Variety, Affinity, Unity, each of them, as ideas, being taken in thehighest degree of their completeness. Reason presupposes the existenceof cognitions of the understanding, which have a direct relation toexperience, and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitions—a unitywhich far transcends all experience or empirical notions. The affinityof the diverse, notwithstanding the differences existing between itsparts, has a relation to things, but a still closer one to the mereproperties and powers of things. For example, imperfect experience mayrepresent the orbits of the planets as circular. But we discovervariations from this course, and we proceed to suppose that the planetsrevolve in a path which, if not a circle, is of a character verysimilar to it. That is to say, the movements of those planets which donot form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of acircle, and probably form an ellipse. The paths of comets exhibit stillgreater variations, for, so far as our observation extends, they do notreturn upon their own course in a circle or ellipse. But we proceed tothe conjecture that comets describe a parabola, a figure which isclosely allied to the ellipse. In fact, a parabola is merely anellipse, with its longer axis produced to an indefinite extent. Thusthese principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms ofthese orbits, and, proceeding farther, to a unity as regards the causeof the motions of the heavenly bodies—that is, gravitation. But we goon extending our conquests over nature, and endeavour to explain allseeming deviations from these rules, and even make additions to oursystem which no experience can ever substantiate—for example, thetheory, in affinity with that of ellipses, of hyperbolic paths ofcomets, pursuing which, these bodies leave our solar system and,passing from sun to sun, unite the most distant parts of the infiniteuniverse, which is held together by the same moving power.The most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles isthat they seem to be transcendental, and, although only containingideas for the guidance of the empirical exercise of reason, andalthough this empirical employment stands to these ideas in anasymptotic relation alone (to use a mathematical term), that is,continually approximate, without ever being able to attain to them,they possess, notwithstanding, as à priori synthetical propositions,objective though undetermined validity, and are available as rules forpossible experience. In the elaboration of our experience, they mayalso be employed with great advantage, as heuristic[70] principles. Atranscendental deduction of them cannot be made; such a deduction beingalways impossible in the case of ideas, as has been already shown. [70] From the Greek, eurhioko.We distinguished, in the Transcendental Analytic, the dynamicalprinciples of the understanding, which are regulative principles ofintuition, from the mathematical, which are constitutive principles ofintuition. These dynamical laws are, however, constitutive in relationto experience, inasmuch as they render the conceptions without whichexperience could not exist possible à priori. But the principles ofpure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empiricalconceptions, because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can bediscovered, and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto. Now,if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, asconstitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment andobjective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can theybe so employed?The understanding is the object of reason, as sensibility is the objectof the understanding. The production of systematic unity in all theempirical operations of the understanding is the proper occupation ofreason; just as it is the business of the understanding to connect thevarious content of phenomena by means of conceptions, and subject themto empirical laws. But the operations of the understanding are, withoutthe schemata of sensibility, undetermined; and, in the same manner, theunity of reason is perfectly undetermined as regards the conditionsunder which, and the extent to which, the understanding ought to carrythe systematic connection of its conceptions. But, although it isimpossible to discover in intuition a schema for the completesystematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding, theremust be some analogon of this schema. This analogon is the idea of themaximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in oneprinciple. For we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and anabsolutely perfect, all the restrictive conditions which are connectedwith an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted. Thusthe idea of reason is analogous with a sensuous schema, with thisdifference, that the application of the categories to the schema ofreason does not present a cognition of any object (as is the case withthe application of the categories to sensuous schemata), but merelyprovides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of theexercise of the understanding. Now, as every principle which imposesupon the exercise of the understanding à priori compliance with therule of systematic unity also relates, although only in an indirectmanner, to an object of experience, the principles of pure reason willalso possess objective reality and validity in relation to experience.But they will not aim at determining our knowledge in regard to anyempirical object; they will merely indicate the procedure, followingwhich the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding maybe in complete harmony and connection with itself—a result which isproduced by its being brought into harmony with the principle ofsystematic unity, so far as that is possible, and deduced from it.I term all subjective principles, which are not derived fromobservation of the constitution of an object, but from the interestwhich Reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognitionof that object, maxims of reason. Thus there are maxims of speculativereason, which are based solely upon its speculative interest, althoughthey appear to be objective principles.When principles which are really regulative are regarded asconstitutive, and employed as objective principles, contradictions mustarise; but if they are considered as mere maxims, there is no room forcontradictions of any kind, as they then merely indicate the differentinterests of reason, which occasion differences in the mode of thought.In effect, Reason has only one single interest, and the seemingcontradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a differencein, and a reciprocal limitation of, the methods by which this interestis satisfied.This reasoner has at heart the interest of diversity—in accordance withthe principle of specification; another, the interest of unity—inaccordance with the principle of aggregation. Each believes that hisjudgement rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he isexamining, and yet it has been influenced solely by a greater or lessdegree of adherence to some one of the two principles, neither of whichare objective, but originate solely from the interest of reason, and onthis account to be termed maxims rather than principles. When I observeintelligent men disputing about the distinctive characteristics of men,animals, or plants, and even of minerals, those on the one sideassuming the existence of certain national characteristics, certainwell-defined and hereditary distinctions of family, race, and so on,while the other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of menwith the same faculties and dispositions, and that all differences arebut the result of external and accidental circumstances—I have only toconsider for a moment the real nature of the subject of discussion, toarrive at the conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us tojudge of, and that there is little probability of either party beingable to speak from a perfect insight into and understanding of thenature of the subject itself. Both have, in reality, been strugglingfor the twofold interest of reason; the one maintaining the oneinterest, the other the other. But this difference between the maximsof diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted; although,so long as they are regarded as objective principles, they mustoccasion not only contradictions and polemic, but place hinderances inthe way of the advancement of truth, until some means is discovered ofreconciling these conflicting interests, and bringing reason into unionand harmony with itself.The same is the case with the so-called law discovered by Leibnitz, andsupported with remarkable ability by Bonnet—the law of the continuousgradation of created beings, which is nothing more than an inferencefrom the principle of affinity; for observation and study of the orderof nature could never present it to the mind as an objective truth. Thesteps of this ladder, as they appear in experience, are too far apartfrom each other, and the so-called petty differences between differentkinds of animals are in nature commonly so wide separations that noconfidence can be placed in such views (particularly when we reflect onthe great variety of things, and the ease with which we can discoverresemblances), and no faith in the laws which are said to express theaims and purposes of nature. On the other hand, the method ofinvestigating the order of nature in the light of this principle, andthe maxim which requires us to regard this order—it being stillundetermined how far it extends—as really existing in nature, is beyonddoubt a legitimate and excellent principle of reason—a principle whichextends farther than any experience or observation of ours and which,without giving us any positive knowledge of anything in the region ofexperience, guides us to the goal of systematic unity._Of the Ultimate End of the Natural Dialectic of Human Reason._The ideas of pure reason cannot be, of themselves and in their ownnature, dialectical; it is from their misemployment alone thatfallacies and illusions arise. For they originate in the nature ofreason itself, and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for allthe rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving ofconfidence and promotive of error. It is to be expected, therefore,that these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim. It is true, the mobof sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency andcontradiction, and affect to despise the government of that faculty,because they cannot understand its constitution, while it is to itsbeneficial influences alone that they owe the position and theintelligence which enable them to criticize and to blame its procedure.We cannot employ an à priori conception with certainty, until we havemade a transcendental deduction therefore. The ideas of pure reason donot admit of the same kind of deduction as the categories. But if theyare to possess the least objective validity, and to represent anythingbut mere creations of thought (entia rationis ratiocinantis), adeduction of them must be possible. This deduction will complete thecritical task imposed upon pure reason; and it is to this part Of ourlabours that we now proceed.There is a great difference between a thing’s being presented to themind as an object in an absolute sense, or merely as an ideal object.In the former case I employ my conceptions to determine the object; inthe latter case nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema, whichdoes not relate directly to an object, not even in a hypotheticalsense, but which is useful only for the purpose of representing otherobjects to the mind, in a mediate and indirect manner, by means oftheir relation to the idea in the intellect. Thus I say the conceptionof a supreme intelligence is a mere idea; that is to say, its objectivereality does not consist in the fact that it has an immediate relationto an object (for in this sense we have no means of establishing itsobjective validity), it is merely a schema constructed according to thenecessary conditions of the unity of reason—the schema of a thing ingeneral, which is useful towards the production of the highest degreeof systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason, in which wededuce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object ofthis idea, as the ground or cause of the said object of experience. Inthis way, the idea is properly a heuristic, and not an ostensive,conception; it does not give us any information respecting theconstitution of an object, it merely indicates how, under the guidanceof the idea, we ought to investigate the constitution and the relationsof objects in the world of experience. Now, if it can be shown that thethree kinds of transcendental ideas (psychological, cosmological, andtheological), although not relating directly to any object nordetermining it, do nevertheless, on the supposition of the existence ofan ideal object, produce systematic unity in the laws of the empiricalemployment of the reason, and extend our empirical cognition, withoutever being inconsistent or in opposition with it—it must be a necessarymaxim of reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas. Andthis forms the transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas, notas constitutive principles of the extension of our cognition beyond thelimits of our experience, but as regulative principles of thesystematic unity of empirical cognition, which is by the aid of theseideas arranged and emended within its own proper limits, to an extentunattainable by the operation of the principles of the understandingalone.I shall make this plainer. Guided by the principles involved in theseideas, we must, in the first place, so connect all the phenomena,actions, and feelings of the mind, as if it were a simple substance,which, endowed with personal identity, possesses a permanent existence(in this life at least), while its states, among which those of thebody are to be included as external conditions, are in continualchange. Secondly, in cosmology, we must investigate the conditions ofall natural phenomena, internal as well as external, as if theybelonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or supreme member,while we do not, on this account, deny the existence of intelligiblegrounds of these phenomena, although we never employ them to explainphenomena, for the simple reason that they are not objects of ourcognition. Thirdly, in the sphere of theology, we must regard the wholesystem of possible experience as forming an absolute, but dependent andsensuously-conditioned unity, and at the same time as based upon asole, supreme, and all-sufficient ground existing apart from the worlditself—a ground which is a self-subsistent, primeval and creativereason, in relation to which we so employ our reason in the field ofexperience, as if all objects drew their origin from that archetype ofall reason. In other words, we ought not to deduce the internalphenomena of the mind from a simple thinking substance, but deduce themfrom each other under the guidance of the regulative idea of a simplebeing; we ought not to deduce the phenomena, order, and unity of theuniverse from a supreme intelligence, but merely draw from this idea ofa supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in itsconnection of causes and effects.Now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possessan objective and hyperbolic existence, except the cosmological ideas,which lead reason into an antinomy: the psychological and theologicalideas are not antinomial. They contain no contradiction; and how, then,can any one dispute their objective reality, since he who denies itknows as little about their possibility as we who affirm? And yet, whenwe wish to admit the existence of a thing, it is not sufficient toconvince ourselves that there is no positive obstacle in the way; forit cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of thought, whichtranscend, though they do not contradict, all our conceptions, as realand determinate objects, solely upon the authority of a speculativereason striving to compass its own aims. They cannot, therefore, beadmitted to be real in themselves; they can only possess a comparativereality—that of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematicunity of all cognition. They are to be regarded not as actual things,but as in some measure analogous to them. We abstract from the objectof the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of ourunderstanding, but which, on the other hand, are the sole conditions ofour possessing a determinate conception of any given thing. And thus wecogitate a something, of the real nature of which we have not the leastconception, but which we represent to ourselves as standing in arelation to the whole system of phenomena, analogous to that in whichphenomena stand to each other.By admitting these ideal beings, we do not really extend our cognitionsbeyond the objects of possible experience; we extend merely theempirical unity of our experience, by the aid of systematic unity, theschema of which is furnished by the idea, which is therefore valid—notas a constitutive, but as a regulative principle. For although we posita thing corresponding to the idea—a something, an actual existence—wedo not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by meansof transcendent conceptions. This existence is purely ideal, and notobjective; it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which isto be the guide of reason in the field of experience. There are noattempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be, or whatthe real nature of this imaginary being.Thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of God, whichis presented to us by speculative reason, is in the strictest sensedeistic. In other words, reason does not assure us of the objectivevalidity of the conception; it merely gives us the idea of something,on which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based.This something we cannot, following the analogy of a real substance,cogitate otherwise than as the cause of all things operating inaccordance with rational laws, if we regard it as an individual object;although we should rest contented with the idea alone as a regulativeprinciple of reason, and make no attempt at completing the sum of theconditions imposed by thought. This attempt is, indeed, inconsistentwith the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere ofcognition—a unity to which no bounds are set by reason.Hence it happens that, admitting a divine being, I can have noconception of the internal possibility of its perfection, or of thenecessity of its existence. The only advantage of this admission isthat it enables me to answer all other questions relating to thecontingent, and to give reason the most complete satisfaction asregards the unity which it aims at attaining in the world ofexperience. But I cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesisitself; and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insightinto the subject, but its speculative interest alone which induces itto proceed from a point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition,for the purpose of being able to consider all objects as parts of asystematic whole.Here a distinction presents itself, in regard to the way in which wemay cogitate a presupposition—a distinction which is somewhat subtle,but of great importance in transcendental philosophy. I may havesufficient grounds to admit something, or the existence of something,in a relative point of view (suppositio relativa), without beingjustified in admitting it in an absolute sense (suppositio absoluta).This distinction is undoubtedly requisite, in the case of a regulativeprinciple, the necessity of which we recognize, though we are ignorantof the source and cause of that necessity, and which we assume to bebased upon some ultimate ground, for the purpose of being able tocogitate the universality of the principle in a more determinate way.For example, I cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to apure transcendental idea. But I cannot admit that this being existsabsolutely and in itself, because all of the conceptions by which I cancogitate an object in a determinate manner fall short of assuring me ofits existence; nay, the conditions of the objective validity of myconceptions are excluded by the idea—by the very fact of its being anidea. The conceptions of reality, substance, causality, nay, even thatof necessity in existence, have no significance out of the sphere ofempirical cognition, and cannot, beyond that sphere, determine anyobject. They may, accordingly, be employed to explain the possibilityof things in the world of sense, but they are utterly inadequate toexplain the possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole;because in this case the ground of explanation must lie out of andbeyond the world, and cannot, therefore, be an object of possibleexperience. Now, I may admit the existence of an incomprehensible beingof this nature—the object of a mere idea, relatively to the world ofsense; although I have no ground to admit its existence absolutely andin itself. For if an idea (that of a systematic and complete unity, ofwhich I shall presently speak more particularly) lies at the foundationof the most extended empirical employment of reason, and if this ideacannot be adequately represented in concreto, although it isindispensably necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to thehighest possible degree—I am not only authorized, but compelled, torealize this idea, that is, to posit a real object correspondingthereto. But I cannot profess to know this object; it is to me merely asomething, to which, as the ground of systematic unity in cognition, Iattribute such properties as are analogous to the conceptions employedby the understanding in the sphere of experience. Following the analogyof the notions of reality, substance, causality, and necessity, Icogitate a being, which possesses all these attributes in the highestdegree; and, as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone, Icogitate this being as self-subsistent reason, and as the cause of theuniverse operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmonyand unity. Thus I abstract all conditions that would limit my idea,solely for the purpose of rendering systematic unity possible in theworld of empirical diversity, and thus securing the widest possibleextension for the exercise of reason in that sphere. This I am enabledto do, by regarding all connections and relations in the world ofsense, as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason, of whichour reason is but a faint image. I then proceed to cogitate thisSupreme Being by conceptions which have, properly, no meaning orapplication, except in the world of sense. But as I am authorized toemploy the transcendental hypothesis of such a being in a relativerespect alone, that is, as the substratum of the greatest possibleunity in experience—I may attribute to a being which I regard asdistinct from the world, such properties as belong solely to the sphereof sense and experience. For I do not desire, and am not justified indesiring, to cognize this object of my idea, as it exists in itself;for I possess no conceptions sufficient for this task, those ofreality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity inexistence, losing all significance, and becoming merely the signs ofconceptions, without content and without applicability, when I attemptto carry them beyond the limits of the world of sense. I cogitatemerely the relation of a perfectly unknown being to the greatestpossible systematic unity of experience, solely for the purpose ofemploying it as the schema of the regulative principle which directsreason in its empirical exercise.It is evident, at the first view, that we cannot presuppose the realityof this transcendental object, by means of the conceptions of reality,substance, causality, and so on, because these conceptions cannot beapplied to anything that is distinct from the world of sense. Thus thesupposition of a Supreme Being or cause is purely relative; it iscogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience; such abeing is but a something, of whose existence in itself we have not theleast conception. Thus, too, it becomes sufficiently manifest why werequired the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given bysense, although we can never have the least conception of this being,or of its absolute necessity.And now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendentaldialectic, and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reason—which becomedialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness. Purereason is, in fact, occupied with itself, and not with any object.Objects are not presented to it to be embraced in the unity of anempirical conception; it is only the cognitions of the understandingthat are presented to it, for the purpose of receiving the unity of arational conception, that is, of being connected according to aprinciple. The unity of reason is the unity of system; and thissystematic unity is not an objective principle, extending its dominionover objects, but a subjective maxim, extending its authority over theempirical cognition of objects. The systematic connection which reasongives to the empirical employment of the understanding not onlyadvances the extension of that employment, but ensures its correctness,and thus the principle of a systematic unity of this nature is alsoobjective, although only in an indefinite respect (principium vagum).It is not, however, a constitutive principle, determining an object towhich it directly relates; it is merely a regulative principle ormaxim, advancing and strengthening the empirical exercise of reason, bythe opening up of new paths of which the understanding is ignorant,while it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the sphere ofexperience.But reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity, without at the sametime cogitating an object of the idea—an object that cannot bepresented in any experience, which contains no concrete example of acomplete systematic unity. This being (ens rationis ratiocinatae) istherefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is realabsolutely and in itself. On the contrary, it forms merely theproblematical foundation of the connection which the mind introducesamong the phenomena of the sensuous world. We look upon thisconnection, in the light of the above-mentioned idea, as if it drew itsorigin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea. And yetall we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation forthe systematic unity of experience—a unity indispensable to reason,advantageous to the understanding, and promotive of the interests ofempirical cognition.We mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as anenouncement, or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence ofa real thing, which we are to regard as the origin or ground of asystematic constitution of the universe. On the contrary, it is leftcompletely undetermined what the nature or properties of this so-calledground may be. The idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view,from which this unity, so essential to reason and so beneficial to theunderstanding, may be regarded as radiating. In one word, thistranscendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle, bymeans of which Reason, so far as in her lies, extends the dominion ofsystematic unity over the whole sphere of experience.The first object of an idea of this kind is the ego, considered merelyas a thinking nature or soul. If I wish to investigate the propertiesof a thinking being, I must interrogate experience. But I find that Ican apply none of the categories to this object, the schema of thesecategories, which is the condition of their application, being givenonly in sensuous intuition. But I cannot thus attain to the cognitionof a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense.Instead, therefore, of an empirical conception of what the soul reallyis, reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all thought,and, by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive,constructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance whichis in itself unchangeable, possessing personal identity, and inconnection with other real things external to it; in one word, itconstructs the idea of a simple self-subsistent intelligence. But thereal aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles ofsystematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul. Thatis, reason desires to be able to represent all the determinations ofthe internal sense as existing in one subject, all powers as deducedfrom one fundamental power, all changes as mere varieties in thecondition of a being which is permanent and always the same, and allphenomena in space as entirely different in their nature from theprocedure of thought. Essential simplicity (with the other attributespredicated of the ego) is regarded as the mere schema of thisregulative principle; it is not assumed that it is the actual ground ofthe properties of the soul. For these properties may rest upon quitedifferent grounds, of which we are completely ignorant; just as theabove predicates could not give us any knowledge of the soul as it isin itself, even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it, inasmuchas they constitute a mere idea, which cannot be represented inconcreto. Nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of thiskind, if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than anidea; that is, if we regard it as valid merely in relation to theemployment of reason, in the sphere of the phenomena of the soul. Underthe guidance of this idea, or principle, no empirical laws of corporealphenomena are called in to explain that which is a phenomenon of theinternal sense alone; no windy hypotheses of the generation,annihilation, and palingenesis of souls are admitted. Thus theconsideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure, andunmixed with heterogeneous elements; while the investigation of reasonaims at reducing all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphereof knowledge to a single principle. All this is best effected, nay,cannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema, whichrequires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence. Thepsychological idea is, therefore, meaningless and inapplicable, exceptas the schema of a regulative conception. For, if I ask whether thesoul is not really of a spiritual nature—it is a question which has nomeaning. From such a conception has been abstracted, not merely allcorporeal nature, but all nature, that is, all the predicates of apossible experience; and consequently, all the conditions which enableus to cogitate an object to this conception have disappeared. But, ifthese conditions are absent, it is evident that the conception ismeaningless.The second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception ofthe universe. For nature is properly the only object presented to us,in regard to which reason requires regulative principles. Nature istwofold—thinking and corporeal nature. To cogitate the latter in regardto its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application ofthe categories to it, no idea is required—no representation whichtranscends experience. In this sphere, therefore, an idea isimpossible, sensuous intuition being our only guide; while, in thesphere of psychology, we require the fundamental idea (I), whichcontains à priori a certain form of thought namely, the unity of theego. Pure reason has, therefore, nothing left but nature in general,and the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with someprinciple. The absolute totality of the series of these conditions isan idea, which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise ofreason, while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reasonin relation to that totality. It requires us, in the explanation ofgiven phenomena (in the regress or ascent in the series), to proceed asif the series were infinite in itself, that is, were prolonged inindefinitum; while on the other hand, where reason is regarded asitself the determining cause (in the region of freedom), we arerequired to proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense, butof the pure understanding. In this latter case, the conditions do notexist in the series of phenomena, but may be placed quite out of andbeyond it, and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had anabsolute beginning from an intelligible cause. All this proves that thecosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles, and notconstitutive; and that their aim is not to realize an actual totalityin such series. The full discussion of this subject will be found inits proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason.The third idea of pure reason, containing the hypothesis of a beingwhich is valid merely as a relative hypothesis, is that of the one andall-sufficient cause of all cosmological series, in other words, theidea of God. We have not the slightest ground absolutely to admit theexistence of an object corresponding to this idea; for what can empoweror authorize us to affirm the existence of a being of the highestperfection—a being whose existence is absolutely necessary—merelybecause we possess the conception of such a being? The answer is: It isthe existence of the world which renders this hypothesis necessary. Butthis answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea of this being,like all other speculative ideas, is essentially nothing more than ademand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it andits subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world byprinciples of systematic unity and, consequently, that it shall regardall phenomena as originating from one all-embracing being, as thesupreme and all-sufficient cause. From this it is plain that the onlyaim of reason in this procedure is the establishment of its own formalrule for the extension of its dominion in the world of experience; thatit does not aim at an extension of its cognition beyond the limits ofexperience; and that, consequently, this idea does not contain anyconstitutive principle.The highest formal unity, which is based upon ideas alone, is the unityof all things—a unity in accordance with an aim or purpose; and thespeculative interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all orderin the world as if it originated from the intention and design of asupreme reason. This principle unfolds to the view of reason in thesphere of experience new and enlarged prospects, and invites it toconnect the phenomena of the world according to teleological laws, andin this way to attain to the highest possible degree of systematicunity. The hypothesis of a supreme intelligence, as the sole cause ofthe universe—an intelligence which has for us no more than an idealexistence—is accordingly always of the greatest service to reason.Thus, if we presuppose, in relation to the figure of the earth (whichis round, but somewhat flattened at the poles),[71] or that ofmountains or seas, wise designs on the part of an author of theuniverse, we cannot fail to make, by the light of this supposition, agreat number of interesting discoveries. If we keep to this hypothesis,as a principle which is purely regulative, even error cannot be verydetrimental. For, in this case, error can have no more seriousconsequences than that, where we expected to discover a teleologicalconnection (nexus finalis), only a mechanical or physical connectionappears. In such a case, we merely fail to find the additional form ofunity we expected, but we do not lose the rational unity which the mindrequires in its procedure in experience. But even a miscarriage of thissort cannot affect the law in its general and teleological relations.For although we may convict an anatomist of an error, when he connectsthe limb of some animal with a certain purpose, it is quite impossibleto prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature, be it what itmay, is entirely without aim or design. And thus medical physiology, bythe aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason, extends its verylimited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts ofan organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmostconfidence, and with the approbation of all reflecting men, that everyorgan or bodily part of an animal has its use and answers a certaindesign. Now, this is a supposition which, if regarded as of aconstitutive character, goes much farther than any experience orobservation of ours can justify. Hence it is evident that it is nothingmore than a regulative principle of reason, which aims at the highestdegree of systematic unity, by the aid of the idea of a causalityaccording to design in a supreme cause—a cause which it regards as thehighest intelligence. [71] The advantages which a circular form, in the case of the earth, has over every other, are well known. But few are aware that the slight flattening at the poles, which gives it the figure of a spheroid, is the only cause which prevents the elevations of continents or even of mountains, perhaps thrown up by some internal convulsion, from continually altering the position of the axis of the earth—and that to some considerable degree in a short time. The great protuberance of the earth under the Equator serves to overbalance the impetus of all other masses of earth, and thus to preserve the axis of the earth, so far as we can observe, in its present position. And yet this wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass.If, however, we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purelyregulative influence, reason is betrayed into numerous errors. For ithas then left the ground of experience, in which alone are to be foundthe criteria of truth, and has ventured into the region of theincomprehensible and unsearchable, on the heights of which it loses itspower and collectedness, because it has completely severed itsconnection with experience.The first error which arises from our employing the idea of a SupremeBeing as a constitutive (in repugnance to the very nature of an idea),and not as a regulative principle, is the error of inactive reason(ignava ratio).[72] We may so term every principle which requires us toregard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete, and allowsreason to cease its inquiries, as if it had fully executed its task.Thus the psychological idea of the ego, when employed as a constitutiveprinciple for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul, and for theextension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits ofexperience—even to the condition of the soul after death—is convenientenough for the purposes of pure reason, but detrimental and evenruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience. Thedogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of ourpersonality through all changes of condition from the unity of athinking substance, the interest which we take in things and eventsthat can happen only after our death, from a consciousness of theimmaterial nature of our thinking subject, and so on. Thus he dispenseswith all empirical investigations into the cause of these internalphenomena, and with all possible explanations of them upon purelynatural grounds; while, at the dictation of a transcendent reason, hepasses by the immanent sources of cognition in experience, greatly tohis own ease and convenience, but to the sacrifice of all, genuineinsight and intelligence. These prejudicial consequences become stillmore evident, in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of aSupreme Intelligence, and the theological system of nature(physico-theology) which is falsely based upon it. For, in this case,the aims which we observe in nature, and often those which we merelyfancy to exist, make the investigation of causes a very easy task, bydirecting us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to theunsearchable will and counsel of the Supreme Wisdom, while we ought toinvestigate their causes in the general laws of the mechanism ofmatter. We are thus recommended to consider the labour of reason asended, when we have merely dispensed with its employment, which isguided surely and safely only by the order of nature and the series ofchanges in the world—which are arranged according to immanent andgeneral laws. This error may be avoided, if we do not merely considerfrom the view-point of final aims certain parts of nature, such as thedivision and structure of a continent, the constitution and directionof certain mountain-chains, or even the organization existing in thevegetable and animal kingdoms, but look upon this systematic unity ofnature in a perfectly general way, in relation to the idea of a SupremeIntelligence. If we pursue this advice, we lay as a foundation for allinvestigation the conformity to aims of all phenomena of nature inaccordance with universal laws, for which no particular arrangement ofnature is exempt, but only cognized by us with more or less difficulty;and we possess a regulative principle of the systematic unity of ateleological connection, which we do not attempt to anticipate orpredetermine. All that we do, and ought to do, is to follow out thephysico-mechanical connection in nature according to general laws, withthe hope of discovering, sooner or later, the teleological connectionalso. Thus, and thus only, can the principle of final unity aid in theextension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience,without being in any case detrimental to its interests. [72] This was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a sophistical argument, which ran thus: If it is your fate to die of this disease, you will die, whether you employ a physician or not. Cicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation, because, if followed, it puts an end to the employment of reason in the affairs of life. For a similar reason, I have applied this designation to the sophistical argument of pure reason.The second error which arises from the misconception of the principleof systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa ratio,usteron roteron rationis). The idea of systematic unity is available asa regulative principle in the connection of phenomena according togeneral natural laws; and, how far soever we have to travel upon thepath of experience to discover some fact or event, this idea requiresus to believe that we have approached all the more nearly to thecompletion of its use in the sphere of nature, although that completioncan never be attained. But this error reverses the procedure of reason.We begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity, and bygiving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a SupremeIntelligence, and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature.Thus not only does teleology, which ought to aid in the completion ofunity in accordance with general laws, operate to the destruction ofits influence, but it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim,that is, the proof, upon natural grounds, of the existence of a supremeintelligent cause. For, if we cannot presuppose supreme finality innature à priori, that is, as essentially belonging to nature, how canwe be directed to endeavour to discover this unity and, risinggradually through its different degrees, to approach the supremeperfection of an author of all—a perfection which is absolutelynecessary, and therefore cognizable à priori? The regulative principledirects us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and, consequently,as following from the essential nature of things—but only as a unity ofnature, not merely cognized empirically, but presupposed à priori,although only in an indeterminate manner. But if I insist on basingnature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining Being, the unity ofnature is in effect lost. For, in this case, it is quite foreign andunessential to the nature of things, and cannot be cognized from thegeneral laws of nature. And thus arises a vicious circular argument,what ought to have been proved having been presupposed.To take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for aconstitutive principle, and to hypostatize and make a cause out of thatwhich is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmoniousexercise of reason, involves reason in inextricable embarrassments. Theinvestigation of nature pursues its own path under the guidance of thechain of natural causes, in accordance with the general laws of nature,and ever follows the light of the idea of an author of the universe—notfor the purpose of deducing the finality, which it constantly pursues,from this Supreme Being, but to attain to the cognition of hisexistence from the finality which it seeks in the existence of thephenomena of nature, and, if possible, in that of all things to cognizethis being, consequently, as absolutely necessary. Whether this latterpurpose succeed or not, the idea is and must always be a true one, andits employment, when merely regulative, must always be accompanied bytruthful and beneficial results.Complete unity, in conformity with aims, constitutes absoluteperfection. But if we do not find this unity in the nature of thethings which go to constitute the world of experience, that is, ofobjective cognition, consequently in the universal and necessary lawsof nature, how can we infer from this unity the idea of the supreme andabsolutely necessary perfection of a primal being, which is the originof all causality? The greatest systematic unity, and consequentlyteleological unity, constitutes the very foundation of the possibilityof the most extended employment of human reason. The idea of unity istherefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of ourreason. This idea is a legislative one; and hence it is very naturalthat we should assume the existence of a legislative reasoncorresponding to it, from which the systematic unity of nature—theobject of the operations of reason—must be derived.In the course of our discussion of the antinomies, we stated that it isalways possible to answer all the questions which pure reason mayraise; and that the plea of the limited nature of our cognition, whichis unavoidable and proper in many questions regarding naturalphenomena, cannot in this case be admitted, because the questionsraised do not relate to the nature of things, but are necessarilyoriginated by the nature of reason itself, and relate to its owninternal constitution. We can now establish this assertion, which atfirst sight appeared so rash, in relation to the two questions in whichreason takes the greatest interest, and thus complete our discussion ofthe dialectic of pure reason.If, then, the question is asked, in relation to transcendentaltheology,[73] first, whether there is anything distinct from the world,which contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according togeneral laws? The answer is: Certainly. For the world is a sum ofphenomena; there must, therefore, be some transcendental basis of thesephenomena, that is, a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone.If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance,whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and soforth? I answer that this question is utterly without meaning. For allthe categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannotbe employed except in the world of sense, and are without meaning whennot applied to objects of actual or possible experience. Out of thissphere, they are not properly conceptions, but the mere marks orindices of conceptions, which we may admit, although they cannot,without the help of experience, help us to understand any subject orthing. If, thirdly, the question is whether we may not cogitate thisbeing, which is distinct from the world, in analogy with the objects ofexperience? The answer is: Undoubtedly, but only as an ideal, and notas a real object. That is, we must cogitate it only as an unknownsubstratum of the systematic unity, order, and finality of the world—aunity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of itsinvestigation of nature. Nay, more, we may admit into the idea certainanthropomorphic elements, which are promotive of the interests of thisregulative principle. For it is no more than an idea, which does notrelate directly to a being distinct from the world, but to theregulative principle of the systematic unity of the world, by means,however, of a schema of this unity—the schema of a SupremeIntelligence, who is the wisely-designing author of the universe. Whatthis basis of cosmical unity may be in itself, we know not—we cannotdiscover from the idea; we merely know how we ought to employ the ideaof this unity, in relation to the systematic operation of reason in thesphere of experience. [73] After what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and its proper employment as a regulative principle of the operations of reason, I need not enter into details regarding the transcendental illusion by which the systematic unity of all the various phenomena of the internal sense is hypostatized. The procedure is in this case very similar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the theological ideal.But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit theexistence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world? Without doubt;and not only so, but we must assume the existence of such a being. Butdo we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field ofpossible experience? By no means. For we have merely presupposed asomething, of which we have no conception, which we do not know as itis in itself; but, in relation to the systematic disposition of theuniverse, which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature, wehave cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligentexistence (an empirical conception), that is to say, we have endowed itwith those attributes, which, judging from the nature of our ownreason, may contain the ground of such a systematic unity. This idea istherefore valid only relatively to the employment in experience of ourreason. But if we attribute to it absolute and objective validity, weoverlook the fact that it is merely an ideal being that we cogitate;and, by setting out from a basis which is not determinable byconsiderations drawn from experience, we place ourselves in a positionwhich incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empiricalemployment of reason.But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conceptionand hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature? Yes, forthis very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamentalbasis. But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have beenmade in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design,and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with theintervention, however, of certain other particular arrangementsdisposed to that end? Yes, you may do so; but at the same time you mustregard it as indifferent, whether it is asserted that divine wisdom hasdisposed all things in conformity with his highest aims, or that theidea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigationof nature, and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity ofnature according to general laws, even in those cases where we areunable to discover that unity. In other words, it must be perfectlyindifferent to you whether you say, when you have discovered thisunity: God has wisely willed it so; or: Nature has wisely arrangedthis. For it was nothing but the systematic unity, which reasonrequires as a basis for the investigation of nature, that justified youin accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for aregulative principle; and, the farther you advance in the discovery ofdesign and finality, the more certain the validity of your idea. But,as the whole aim of this regulative principle was the discovery of anecessary and systematic unity in nature, we have, in so far as weattain this, to attribute our success to the idea of a Supreme Being;while, at the same time, we cannot, without involving ourselves incontradictions, overlook the general laws of nature, as it was inreference to them alone that this idea was employed. We cannot, I say,overlook the general laws of nature, and regard this conformity to aimsobservable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin;inasmuch as there is no ground which can justify us in the admission ofa being with such properties distinct from and above nature. All thatwe are authorized to assert is that this idea may be employed as aprinciple, and that the properties of the being which is assumed tocorrespond to it may be regarded as systematically connected in analogywith the causal determination of phenomena.For the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea ofthe supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements (for without these wecould not predicate anything of it); we may regard it as allowable tocogitate this cause as a being with understanding, the feelings ofpleasure and displeasure, and faculties of desire and willcorresponding to these. At the same time, we may attribute to thisbeing infinite perfection—a perfection which necessarily transcendsthat which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorizeus to predicate of it. For the regulative law of systematic unityrequires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic andfinal unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable, even in thehighest diversity. For, although we may discover little of thiscosmical perfection, it belongs to the legislative prerogative ofreason to require us always to seek for and to expect it; while it mustalways be beneficial to institute all inquiries into nature inaccordance with this principle. But it is evident that, by this idea ofa supreme author of all, which I place as the foundation of allinquiries into nature, I do not mean to assert the existence of such abeing, or that I have any knowledge of its existence; and,consequently, I do not really deduce anything from the existence ofthis being, but merely from its idea, that is to say, from the natureof things in this world, in accordance with this idea. A certain dimconsciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated tothe philosophers of all times the moderate language used by themregarding the cause of the world. We find them employing theexpressions wisdom and care of nature, and divine wisdom, assynonymous—nay, in purely speculative discussions, preferring theformer, because it does not carry the appearance of greater pretensionsthan such as we are entitled to make, and at the same time directsreason to its proper field of action—nature and her phenomena.Thus, pure reason, which at first seemed to promise us nothing lessthan the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience, isfound, when thoroughly examined, to contain nothing but regulativeprinciples, the virtue and function of which is to introduce into ourcognition a higher degree of unity than the understanding could ofitself. These principles, by placing the goal of all our struggles atso great a distance, realize for us the most thorough connectionbetween the different parts of our cognition, and the highest degree ofsystematic unity. But, on the other hand, if misunderstood and employedas constitutive principles of transcendent cognition, they become theparents of illusions and contradictions, while pretending to introduceus to new regions of knowledge.Thus all human cognition begins with intuitions, proceeds from thenceto conceptions, and ends with ideas. Although it possesses, in relationto all three elements, à priori sources of cognition, which seemed totranscend the limits of all experience, a thoroughgoing criticismdemonstrates that speculative reason can never, by the aid of theseelements, pass the bounds of possible experience, and that the properdestination of this highest faculty of cognition is to employ allmethods, and all the principles of these methods, for the purpose ofpenetrating into the innermost secrets of nature, by the aid of theprinciples of unity (among all kinds of which teleological unity is thehighest), while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere ofexperience, beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane.The critical examination, in our Transcendental Analytic, of all thepropositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere ofexperience, completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to apossible experience. If we were not distrustful even of the clearestabstract theorems, if we were not allured by specious and invitingprospects to escape from the constraining power of their evidence, wemight spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the dialecticalarguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of itspretensions; for we should know with the most complete certainty that,however honest such professions might be, they are null and valueless,because they relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by anypossibility attain. But, as there is no end to discussion, if we cannotdiscover the true cause of the illusions by which even the wisest aredeceived, and as the analysis of all our transcendent cognition intoits elements is of itself of no slight value as a psychological study,while it is a duty incumbent on every philosopher—it was foundnecessary to investigate the dialectical procedure of reason in itsprimary sources. And as the inferences of which this dialectic is theparent are not only deceitful, but naturally possess a profoundinterest for humanity, it was advisable at the same time, to give afull account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure, and todeposit it in the archives of human reason, as a warning to all futuremetaphysicians to avoid these causes of speculative error.II. Transcendental Doctrine of MethodIf we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as anedifice, the idea of which, at least, exists in the human mind, it maybe said that we have in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elementsexamined the materials and determined to what edifice these belong, andwhat its height and stability. We have found, indeed, that, although wehad purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach toHeaven, the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation, whichwas spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes, and high enough toenable us to survey the level plain of experience, but that the boldundertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materials—not tomention the confusion of tongues, which gave rise to endless disputesamong the labourers on the plan of the edifice, and at last scatteredthem over all the world, each to erect a separate building for himself,according to his own plans and his own inclinations. Our present taskrelates not to the materials, but to the plan of an edifice; and, as wehave had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design whichmay be found to transcend our natural powers, while, at the same time,we cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for themind, we must proportion our design to the material which is presentedto us, and which is, at the same time, sufficient for all our wants.I understand, then, by the transcendental doctrine of method, thedetermination of the formal conditions of a complete system of purereason. We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, thecanon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason.This part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendentalpoint of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed,under the name of practical logic. It has been badly executed, I say,because general logic, not being limited to any particular kind ofcognition (not even to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor toany particular objects, it cannot, without borrowing from othersciences, do more than present merely the titles or signs of possiblemethods and the technical expressions, which are employed in thesystematic parts of all sciences; and thus the pupil is made acquaintedwith names, the meaning and application of which he is to learn only atsome future time.Chapter I. The Discipline of Pure ReasonNegative judgements—those which are so not merely as regards theirlogical form, but in respect of their content—are not commonly held inespecial respect. They are, on the contrary, regarded as jealousenemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge; and it almost requiresan apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respectthem.All propositions, indeed, may be logically expressed in a negativeform; but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiarprovince of negative judgements is solely to prevent error. For thisreason, too, negative propositions, which are framed for the purpose ofcorrecting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible, areundoubtedly true, but inane and senseless; that is, they are in realitypurposeless and, for this reason, often very ridiculous. Such is theproposition of the schoolman that Alexander could not have subdued anycountries without an army.But where the limits of our possible cognition are very muchcontracted, the attraction to new fields of knowledge great, theillusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character,and the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitude—thenegative element in knowledge, which is useful only to guard us againsterror, is of far more importance than much of that positive instructionwhich makes additions to the sum of our knowledge. The restraint whichis employed to repress, and finally to extirpate the constantinclination to depart from certain rules, is termed discipline. It isdistinguished from culture, which aims at the formation of a certaindegree of skill, without attempting to repress or to destroy any othermental power, already existing. In the cultivation of a talent, whichhas given evidence of an impulse towards self-development, disciplinetakes a negative,[74] culture and doctrine a positive, part. [74] I am well aware that, in the language of the schools, the term discipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction. But there are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the notion of the former, as a course of corrective training, from that of the latter, as the communication of knowledge, and the nature of things itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable expressions for this distinction, that it is my desire that the former terms should never be employed in any other than a negative signification.That natural dispositions and talents (such as imagination and wit),which ask a free and unlimited development, require in many respectsthe corrective influence of discipline, every one will readily grant.But it may well appear strange that reason, whose proper duty it is toprescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind,should itself require this corrective. It has, in fact, hithertoescaped this humiliation, only because, in presence of its magnificentpretensions and high position, no one could readily suspect it to becapable of substituting fancies for conceptions, and words for things.Reason, when employed in the field of experience, does not stand inneed of criticism, because its principles are subjected to thecontinual test of empirical observations. Nor is criticism requisite inthe sphere of mathematics, where the conceptions of reason must alwaysbe presented in concreto in pure intuition, and baseless or arbitraryassertions are discovered without difficulty. But where reason is notheld in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pureintuition, that is, when it is employed in the transcendental sphere ofpure conceptions, it stands in great need of discipline, to restrainits propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and tokeep it from wandering into error. In fact, the utility of thephilosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character.Particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions, andthe causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism. But where wefind, as in the case of pure reason, a complete system of illusions andfallacies, closely connected with each other and depending upon grandgeneral principles, there seems to be required a peculiar and negativecode of mental legislation, which, under the denomination of adiscipline, and founded upon the nature of reason and the objects ofits exercise, shall constitute a system of thorough examination andtesting, which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from,under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk.But the reader must remark that, in this the second division of ourtranscendental Critique the discipline of pure reason is not directedto the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason. Theformer task has been completed in the doctrine of elements. But thereis so much similarity in the mode of employing the faculty of reason,whatever be the object to which it is applied, while, at the same time,its employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially differentin kind from every other, that, without the warning negative influenceof a discipline specially directed to that end, the errors areunavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the methodswhich are originated by reason but which are out of place in thissphere.Section I. The Discipline of Pure Reason in the Sphere of DogmatismThe science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of theextension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience.Examples are always contagious; and they exert an especial influence onthe same faculty, which naturally flatters itself that it will have thesame good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunateinstance. Hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire inthe transcendental sphere with equal success and security, especiallywhen it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliantresults in the science of mathematics. It is, therefore, of the highestimportance for us to know whether the method of arriving atdemonstrative certainty, which is termed mathematical, be identicalwith that by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certaintyin philosophy, and which is termed in that science dogmatical.Philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means ofconceptions; mathematical cognition is cognition by means of theconstruction of conceptions. The construction of a conception is thepresentation à priori of the intuition which corresponds to theconception. For this purpose a non-empirical intuition is requisite,which, as an intuition, is an individual object; while, as theconstruction of a conception (a general representation), it must beseen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which rankunder that conception. Thus I construct a triangle, by the presentationof the object which corresponds to this conception, either by mereimagination, in pure intuition, or upon paper, in empirical intuition,in both cases completely à priori, without borrowing the type of thatfigure from any experience. The individual figure drawn upon paper isempirical; but it serves, notwithstanding, to indicate the conception,even in its universality, because in this empirical intuition we keepour eye merely on the act of the construction of the conception, andpay no attention to the various modes of determining it, for example,its size, the length of its sides, the size of its angles, these not inthe least affecting the essential character of the conception.Philosophical cognition, accordingly, regards the particular only inthe general; mathematical the general in the particular, nay, in theindividual. This is done, however, entirely à priori and by means ofpure reason, so that, as this individual figure is determined undercertain universal conditions of construction, the object of theconception, to which this individual figure corresponds as its schema,must be cogitated as universally determined.The essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists,therefore, in this formal quality; it does not regard the difference ofthe matter or objects of both. Those thinkers who aim at distinguishingphilosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do withquality merely, and the latter with quantity, have mistaken the effectfor the cause. The reason why mathematical cognition can relate only toquantity is to be found in its form alone. For it is the conception ofquantities only that is capable of being constructed, that is,presented à priori in intuition; while qualities cannot be given in anyother than an empirical intuition. Hence the cognition of qualities byreason is possible only through conceptions. No one can find anintuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality, exceptin experience; it cannot be presented to the mind à priori andantecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality. We can forman intuition, by means of the mere conception of it, of a cone, withoutthe aid of experience; but the colour of the cone we cannot know exceptfrom experience. I cannot present an intuition of a cause, except in anexample which experience offers to me. Besides, philosophy, as well asmathematics, treats of quantities; as, for example, of totality,infinity, and so on. Mathematics, too, treats of the difference oflines and surfaces—as spaces of different quality, of the continuity ofextension—as a quality thereof. But, although in such cases they have acommon object, the mode in which reason considers that object is verydifferent in philosophy from what it is in mathematics. The formerconfines itself to the general conceptions; the latter can do nothingwith a mere conception, it hastens to intuition. In this intuition itregards the conception in concreto, not empirically, but in an à prioriintuition, which it has constructed; and in which, all the resultswhich follow from the general conditions of the construction of theconception are in all cases valid for the object of the constructedconception.Suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher andthat he is required to discover, by the philosophical method, whatrelation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle. He has nothingbefore him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three rightlines, and, consequently, with the same number of angles. He mayanalyse the conception of a right line, of an angle, or of the numberthree as long as he pleases, but he will not discover any propertiesnot contained in these conceptions. But, if this question is proposedto a geometrician, he at once begins by constructing a triangle. Heknows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguousangles which proceed from one point in a straight line; and he goes onto produce one side of his triangle, thus forming two adjacent angleswhich are together equal to two right angles. He then divides theexterior of these angles, by drawing a line parallel with the oppositeside of the triangle, and immediately perceives that he has thus got anexterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior. Proceeding inthis way, through a chain of inferences, and always on the ground ofintuition, he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of thequestion.But mathematics does not confine itself to the construction ofquantities (quanta), as in the case of geometry; it occupies itselfwith pure quantity also (quantitas), as in the case of algebra, wherecomplete abstraction is made of the properties of the object indicatedby the conception of quantity. In algebra, a certain method of notationby signs is adopted, and these indicate the different possibleconstructions of quantities, the extraction of roots, and so on. Afterhaving thus denoted the general conception of quantities, according totheir different relations, the different operations by which quantityor number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition inaccordance with general rules. Thus, when one quantity is to be dividedby another, the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiarto the operation of division; and thus algebra, by means of asymbolical construction of quantity, just as geometry, with itsostensive or geometrical construction (a construction of the objectsthemselves), arrives at results which discursive cognition cannot hopeto reach by the aid of mere conceptions.Now, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of thephilosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the pathof conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which herepresents, à priori, in correspondence with his conceptions? The causeis evident from what has been already demonstrated in the introductionto this Critique. We do not, in the present case, want to discoveranalytical propositions, which may be produced merely by analysing ourconceptions—for in this the philosopher would have the advantage overhis rival; we aim at the discovery of synthetical propositions—suchsynthetical propositions, moreover, as can be cognized à priori. I mustnot confine myself to that which I actually cogitate in my conceptionof a triangle, for this is nothing more than the mere definition; Imust try to go beyond that, and to arrive at properties which are notcontained in, although they belong to, the conception. Now, this isimpossible, unless I determine the object present to my mind accordingto the conditions, either of empirical, or of pure, intuition. In theformer case, I should have an empirical proposition (arrived at byactual measurement of the angles of the triangle), which would possessneither universality nor necessity; but that would be of no value. Inthe latter, I proceed by geometrical construction, by means of which Icollect, in a pure intuition, just as I would in an empiricalintuition, all the various properties which belong to the schema of atriangle in general, and consequently to its conception, and thusconstruct synthetical propositions which possess the attribute ofuniversality.It would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle, that is, to reflecton it discursively; I should get no further than the definition withwhich I had been obliged to set out. There are certainly transcendentalsynthetical propositions which are framed by means of pure conceptions,and which form the peculiar distinction of philosophy; but these do notrelate to any particular thing, but to a thing in general, and enouncethe conditions under which the perception of it may become a part ofpossible experience. But the science of mathematics has nothing to dowith such questions, nor with the question of existence in any fashion;it is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves,only in so far as these are connected with the conception of theobjects.In the above example, we merely attempted to show the great differencewhich exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphereof conceptions, and its intuitive exercise by means of the constructionof conceptions. The question naturally arises: What is the cause whichnecessitates this twofold exercise of reason, and how are we todiscover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical methodwhich reason is pursuing in an argument?All our knowledge relates, finally, to possible intuitions, for it isthese alone that present objects to the mind. An à priori ornon-empirical conception contains either a pure intuition—and in thiscase it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis ofpossible intuitions, which are not given à priori. In this latter case,it may help us to form synthetical à priori judgements, but only in thediscursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means ofthe construction of conceptions.The only à priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomena—spaceand time. A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented àpriori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with theirquality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of thehomogeneous), by means of number. But the matter of phenomena, by whichthings are given in space and time, can be presented only inperception, à posteriori. The only conception which represents à priorithis empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing ingeneral; and the à priori synthetical cognition of this conception cangive us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which maybe contained in the corresponding à posteriori perception; it isutterly inadequate to present an à priori intuition of the real object,which must necessarily be empirical.Synthetical propositions, which relate to things in general, an àpriori intuition of which is impossible, are transcendental. For thisreason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of theconstruction of conceptions; they are à priori, and based entirely onconceptions themselves. They contain merely the rule, by which we areto seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unityof that which cannot be intuited à priori. But they are incompetent topresent any of the conceptions which appear in them in an à prioriintuition; these can be given only à posteriori, in experience, which,however, is itself possible only through these synthetical principles.If we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception, wemust go beyond it, to the intuition in which it is given. If we keep towhat is contained in the conception, the judgement is merelyanalytical—it is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in theconception. But I can pass from the conception to the pure or empiricalintuition which corresponds to it. I can proceed to examine myconception in concreto, and to cognize, either à priori or a posterio,what I find in the object of the conception. The former—à prioricognition—is rational-mathematical cognition by means of theconstruction of the conception; the latter—à posteriori cognition—ispurely empirical cognition, which does not possess the attributes ofnecessity and universality. Thus I may analyse the conception I have ofgold; but I gain no new information from this analysis, I merelyenumerate the different properties which I had connected with thenotion indicated by the word. My knowledge has gained in logicalclearness and arrangement, but no addition has been made to it. But ifI take the matter which is indicated by this name, and submit it to theexamination of my senses, I am enabled to form severalsynthetical—although still empirical—propositions. The mathematicalconception of a triangle I should construct, that is, present à prioriin intuition, and in this way attain to rational-synthetical cognition.But when the transcendental conception of reality, or substance, orpower is presented to my mind, I find that it does not relate to orindicate either an empirical or pure intuition, but that it indicatesmerely the synthesis of empirical intuitions, which cannot of course begiven à priori. The synthesis in such a conception cannot proceed àpriori—without the aid of experience—to the intuition which correspondsto the conception; and, for this reason, none of these conceptions canproduce a determinative synthetical proposition, they can never presentmore than a principle of the synthesis[75] of possible empiricalintuitions. A transcendental proposition is, therefore, a syntheticalcognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursivemethod, and it renders possible all synthetical unity in empiricalcognition, though it cannot present us with any intuition à priori. [75] In the case of the conception of cause, I do really go beyond the empirical conception of an event—but not to the intuition which presents this conception in concreto, but only to the time-conditions, which may be found in experience to correspond to the conception. My procedure is, therefore, strictly according to conceptions; I cannot in a case of this kind employ the construction of conceptions, because the conception is merely a rule for the synthesis of perceptions, which are not pure intuitions, and which, therefore, cannot be given à priori.There is thus a twofold exercise of reason. Both modes have theproperties of universality and an à priori origin in common, but are,in their procedure, of widely different character. The reason of thisis that in the world of phenomena, in which alone objects are presentedto our minds, there are two main elements—the form of intuition (spaceand time), which can be cognized and determined completely à priori,and the matter or content—that which is presented in space and time,and which, consequently, contains a something—an existencecorresponding to our powers of sensation. As regards the latter, whichcan never be given in a determinate mode except by experience, thereare no à priori notions which relate to it, except the undeterminedconceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations, in so far as thesebelong (in a possible experience) to the unity of consciousness. Asregards the former, we can determine our conceptions à priori inintuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects ofthe conceptions in space and time—these objects being regarded simplyas quanta. In the one case, reason proceeds according to conceptionsand can do nothing more than subject phenomena to these—which can onlybe determined empirically, that is, à posteriori—in conformity,however, with those conceptions as the rules of all empiricalsynthesis. In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction ofconceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an à priori intuition,they may be given and determined in pure intuition à priori, andwithout the aid of empirical data. The examination and consideration ofeverything that exists in space or time—whether it is a quantum or not,in how far the particular something (which fills space or time) is aprimary substratum, or a mere determination of some other existence,whether it relates to anything else—either as cause or effect, whetherits existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with anddependence upon others, the possibility of this existence, its realityand necessity or opposites—all these form part of the cognition ofreason on the ground of conceptions, and this cognition is termedphilosophical. But to determine à priori an intuition in space (itsfigure), to divide time into periods, or merely to cognize the quantityof an intuition in space and time, and to determine it by number—allthis is an operation of reason by means of the construction ofconceptions, and is called mathematical.The success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere ofmathematics naturally fosters the expectation that the same goodfortune will be its lot, if it applies the mathematical method in otherregions of mental endeavour besides that of quantities. Its success isthus great, because it can support all its conceptions by à prioriintuitions and, in this way, make itself a master, as it were, overnature; while pure philosophy, with its à priori discursiveconceptions, bungles about in the world of nature, and cannot accreditor show any à priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions.Masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success ofthis method; indeed, it is a common persuasion that it is capable ofbeing applied to any subject of human thought. They have hardly everreflected or philosophized on their favourite science—a task of greatdifficulty; and the specific difference between the two modes ofemploying the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts. Rulescurrent in the field of common experience, and which common sensestamps everywhere with its approval, are regarded by them as axiomatic.From what source the conceptions of space and time, with which (as theonly primitive quanta) they have to deal, enter their minds, is aquestion which they do not trouble themselves to answer; and they thinkit just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pureconceptions of the understanding and the extent of their validity. Allthey have to do with them is to employ them. In all this they areperfectly right, if they do not overstep the limits of the sphere ofnature. But they pass, unconsciously, from the world of sense to theinsecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions (instabilis tellus,innabilis unda), where they can neither stand nor swim, and where thetracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time; while the march ofmathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway, which thelatest posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment.As we have taken upon us the task of determining, clearly andcertainly, the limits of pure reason in the sphere oftranscendentalism, and as the efforts of reason in this direction arepersisted in, even after the plainest and most expressive warnings,hope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into thesplendours of the intellectual world—it becomes necessary to cut awaythe last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope. We shall,accordingly, show that the mathematical method is unattended in thesphere of philosophy by the least advantage—except, perhaps, that itmore plainly exhibits its own inadequacy—that geometry and philosophyare two quite different things, although they go hand in hand in thefield of natural science, and, consequently, that the procedure of theone can never be imitated by the other.The evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions, axioms, anddemonstrations. I shall be satisfied with showing that none of theseforms can be employed or imitated in philosophy in the sense in whichthey are understood by mathematicians; and that the geometrician, if heemploys his method in philosophy, will succeed only in buildingcard-castles, while the employment of the philosophical method inmathematics can result in nothing but mere verbiage. The essentialbusiness of philosophy, indeed, is to mark out the limits of thescience; and even the mathematician, unless his talent is naturallycircumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge,cannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy, or set himselfabove its direction.I. Of Definitions. A definition is, as the term itself indicates, therepresentation, upon primary grounds, of the complete conception of athing within its own limits.[76] Accordingly, an empirical conceptioncannot be defined, it can only be explained. For, as there are in sucha conception only a certain number of marks or signs, which denote acertain class of sensuous objects, we can never be sure that we do notcogitate under the word which indicates the same object, at one time agreater, at another a smaller number of signs. Thus, one person maycogitate in his conception of gold, in addition to its properties ofweight, colour, malleability, that of resisting rust, while anotherperson may be ignorant of this quality. We employ certain signs only solong as we require them for the sake of distinction; new observationsabstract some and add new ones, so that an empirical conception neverremains within permanent limits. It is, in fact, useless to define aconception of this kind. If, for example, we are speaking of water andits properties, we do not stop at what we actually think by the wordwater, but proceed to observation and experiment; and the word, withthe few signs attached to it, is more properly a designation than aconception of the thing. A definition in this case would evidently benothing more than a determination of the word. In the second place, noà priori conception, such as those of substance, cause, right, fitness,and so on, can be defined. For I can never be sure, that the clearrepresentation of a given conception (which is given in a confusedstate) has been fully developed, until I know that the representationis adequate with its object. But, inasmuch as the conception, as it ispresented to the mind, may contain a number of obscure representations,which we do not observe in our analysis, although we employ them in ourapplication of the conception, I can never be sure that my analysis iscomplete, while examples may make this probable, although they cannever demonstrate the fact. Instead of the word definition, I shouldrather employ the term exposition—a more modest expression, which thecritic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to thecompleteness of the analysis of any such conception. As, therefore,neither empirical nor à priori conceptions are capable of definition,we have to see whether the only other kind of conceptions—arbitraryconceptions—can be subjected to this mental operation. Such aconception can always be defined; for I must know thoroughly what Iwished to cogitate in it, as it was I who created it, and it was notgiven to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or byexperience. At the same time, I cannot say that, by such a definition,I have defined a real object. If the conception is based upon empiricalconditions, if, for example, I have a conception of a clock for a ship,this arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or evenof the possibility of the object. My definition of such a conceptionwould with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than adefinition of an object. There are no other conceptions which can beardefinition, except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis, whichcan be constructed à priori. Consequently, the science of mathematicsalone possesses definitions. For the object here thought is presented àpriori in intuition; and thus it can never contain more or less thanthe conception, because the conception of the object has been given bythe definition—and primarily, that is, without deriving the definitionfrom any other source. Philosophical definitions are, therefore, merelyexpositions of given conceptions, while mathematical definitions areconstructions of conceptions originally formed by the mind itself; theformer are produced by analysis, the completeness of which is neverdemonstratively certain, the latter by a synthesis. In a mathematicaldefinition the conception is formed, in a philosophical definition itis only explained. From this it follows: [76] The definition must describe the conception completely that is, omit none of the marks or signs of which it composed; within its own limits, that is, it must be precise, and enumerate no more signs than belong to the conception; and on primary grounds, that is to say, the limitations of the bounds of the conception must not be deduced from other conceptions, as in this case a proof would be necessary, and the so-called definition would be incapable of taking its place at the head of all the judgements we have to form regarding an object.(a) That we must not imitate, in philosophy, the mathematical usage ofcommencing with definitions—except by way of hypothesis or experiment.For, as all so-called philosophical definitions are merely analyses ofgiven conceptions, these conceptions, although only in a confused form,must precede the analysis; and the incomplete exposition must precedethe complete, so that we may be able to draw certain inferences fromthe characteristics which an incomplete analysis has enabled us todiscover, before we attain to the complete exposition or definition ofthe conception. In one word, a full and clear definition ought, inphilosophy, rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of ourlabours.[77] In mathematics, on the contrary, we cannot have aconception prior to the definition; it is the definition which gives usthe conception, and it must for this reason form the commencement ofevery chain of mathematical reasoning. [77] Philosophy abounds in faulty definitions, especially such as contain some of the elements requisite to form a complete definition. If a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been defined, it would fare ill with all philosophical thought. But, as incompletely defined conceptions may always be employed without detriment to truth, so far as our analysis of the elements contained in them proceeds, imperfect definitions, that is, propositions which are properly not definitions, but merely approximations thereto, may be used with great advantage. In mathematics, definition belongs ad esse, in philosophy ad melius esse. It is a difficult task to construct a proper definition. Jurists are still without a complete definition of the idea of right.(b) Mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous. For the conception isgiven only in and through the definition, and thus it contains onlywhat has been cogitated in the definition. But although a definitioncannot be incorrect, as regards its content, an error may sometimes,although seldom, creep into the form. This error consists in a want ofprecision. Thus the common definition of a circle—that it is a curvedline, every point in which is equally distant from another point calledthe centre—is faulty, from the fact that the determination indicated bythe word curved is superfluous. For there ought to be a particulartheorem, which may be easily proved from the definition, to the effectthat every line, which has all its points at equal distances fromanother point, must be a curved line—that is, that not even thesmallest part of it can be straight. Analytical definitions, on theother hand, may be erroneous in many respects, either by theintroduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception, orby wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of adefinition. In the latter case, the definition is necessarilydefective, because we can never be fully certain of the completeness ofour analysis. For these reasons, the method of definition employed inmathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy.2. Of Axioms. These, in so far as they are immediately certain, are àpriori synthetical principles. Now, one conception cannot be connectedsynthetically and yet immediately with another; because, if we wish toproceed out of and beyond a conception, a third mediating cognition isnecessary. And, as philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid ofconceptions alone, there is to be found in it no principle whichdeserves to be called an axiom. Mathematics, on the other hand, maypossess axioms, because it can always connect the predicates of anobject à priori, and without any mediating term, by means of theconstruction of conceptions in intuition. Such is the case with theproposition: Three points can always lie in a plane. On the other hand,no synthetical principle which is based upon conceptions, can ever beimmediately certain (for example, the proposition: Everything thathappens has a cause), because I require a mediating term to connect thetwo conceptions of event and cause—namely, the condition oftime-determination in an experience, and I cannot cognize any suchprinciple immediately and from conceptions alone. Discursive principlesare, accordingly, very different from intuitive principles or axioms.The former always require deduction, which in the case of the lattermay be altogether dispensed with. Axioms are, for this reason, alwaysself-evident, while philosophical principles, whatever may be thedegree of certainty they possess, cannot lay any claim to such adistinction. No synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reasoncan be so evident, as is often rashly enough declared, as thestatement, twice two are four. It is true that in the Analytic Iintroduced into the list of principles of the pure understanding,certain axioms of intuition; but the principle there discussed was notitself an axiom, but served merely to present the principle of thepossibility of axioms in general, while it was really nothing more thana principle based upon conceptions. For it is one part of the duty oftranscendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematicsitself. Philosophy possesses, then, no axioms, and has no right toimpose its à priori principles upon thought, until it has establishedtheir authority and validity by a thoroughgoing deduction.3. Of Demonstrations. Only an apodeictic proof, based upon intuition,can be termed a demonstration. Experience teaches us what is, but itcannot convince us that it might not have been otherwise. Hence a proofupon empirical grounds cannot be apodeictic. À priori conceptions, indiscursive cognition, can never produce intuitive certainty orevidence, however certain the judgement they present may be.Mathematics alone, therefore, contains demonstrations, because it doesnot deduce its cognition from conceptions, but from the construction ofconceptions, that is, from intuition, which can be given à priori inaccordance with conceptions. The method of algebra, in equations, fromwhich the correct answer is deduced by reduction, is a kind ofconstruction—not geometrical, but by symbols—in which all conceptions,especially those of the relations of quantities, are represented inintuition by signs; and thus the conclusions in that science aresecured from errors by the fact that every proof is submitted to ocularevidence. Philosophical cognition does not possess this advantage, itbeing required to consider the general always in abstracto (by means ofconceptions), while mathematics can always consider it in concreto (inan individual intuition), and at the same time by means of à priorirepresentation, whereby all errors are rendered manifest to the senses.The former—discursive proofs—ought to be termed acroamatic proofs,rather than demonstrations, as only words are employed in them, whiledemonstrations proper, as the term itself indicates, always require areference to the intuition of the object.It follows from all these considerations that it is not consonant withthe nature of philosophy, especially in the sphere of pure reason, toemploy the dogmatical method, and to adorn itself with the titles andinsignia of mathematical science. It does not belong to that order, andcan only hope for a fraternal union with that science. Its attempts atmathematical evidence are vain pretensions, which can only keep it backfrom its true aim, which is to detect the illusory procedure of reasonwhen transgressing its proper limits, and by fully explaining andanalysing our conceptions, to conduct us from the dim regions ofspeculation to the clear region of modest self-knowledge. Reason mustnot, therefore, in its transcendental endeavours, look forward withsuch confidence, as if the path it is pursuing led straight to its aim,nor reckon with such security upon its premisses, as to consider itunnecessary to take a step back, or to keep a strict watch for errors,which, overlooked in the principles, may be detected in the argumentsthemselves—in which case it may be requisite either to determine theseprinciples with greater strictness, or to change them entirely.I divide all apodeictic propositions, whether demonstrable orimmediately certain, into dogmata and mathemata. A direct syntheticalproposition, based on conceptions, is a dogma; a proposition of thesame kind, based on the construction of conceptions, is a mathema.Analytical judgements do not teach us any more about an object thanwhat was contained in the conception we had of it; because they do notextend our cognition beyond our conception of an object, they merelyelucidate the conception. They cannot therefore be with proprietytermed dogmas. Of the two kinds of à priori synthetical propositionsabove mentioned, only those which are employed in philosophy can,according to the general mode of speech, bear this name; those ofarithmetic or geometry would not be rightly so denominated. Thus thecustomary mode of speaking confirms the explanation given above, andthe conclusion arrived at, that only those judgements which are basedupon conceptions, not on the construction of conceptions, can be termeddogmatical.Thus, pure reason, in the sphere of speculation, does not contain asingle direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions. By means ofideas, it is, as we have shown, incapable of producing syntheticaljudgements, which are objectively valid; by means of the conceptions ofthe understanding, it establishes certain indubitable principles, not,however, directly on the basis of conceptions, but only indirectly bymeans of the relation of these conceptions to something of a purelycontingent nature, namely, possible experience. When experience ispresupposed, these principles are apodeictically certain, but inthemselves, and directly, they cannot even be cognized à priori. Thusthe given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient for thedemonstration of the proposition: Every event has a cause. For thisreason, it is not a dogma; although from another point of view, that ofexperience, it is capable of being proved to demonstration. The properterm for such a proposition is principle, and not theorem (although itdoes require to be proved), because it possesses the remarkablepeculiarity of being the condition of the possibility of its own groundof proof, that is, experience, and of forming a necessarypresupposition in all empirical observation.If then, in the speculative sphere of pure reason, no dogmata are to befound; all dogmatical methods, whether borrowed from mathematics, orinvented by philosophical thinkers, are alike inappropriate andinefficient. They only serve to conceal errors and fallacies, and todeceive philosophy, whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safeand straight path. A philosophical method may, however, besystematical. For our reason is, subjectively considered, itself asystem, and, in the sphere of mere conceptions, a system ofinvestigation according to principles of unity, the material beingsupplied by experience alone. But this is not the proper place fordiscussing the peculiar method of transcendental philosophy, as ourpresent task is simply to examine whether our faculties are capable oferecting an edifice on the basis of pure reason, and how far they mayproceed with the materials at their command.Section II. The Discipline of Pure Reason in PolemicsReason must be subject, in all its operations, to criticism, which mustalways be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint;otherwise its interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious tosuspicion. There is nothing, however useful, however sacred it may be,that can claim exemption from the searching examination of this supremetribunal, which has no respect of persons. The very existence of reasondepends upon this freedom; for the voice of reason is not that of adictatorial and despotic power, it is rather like the vote of thecitizens of a free state, every member of which must have the privilegeof giving free expression to his doubts, and possess even the right ofveto.But while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal ofcriticism, it has not always cause to dread the judgement of thiscourt. Pure reason, however, when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism,is not so thoroughly conscious of a strict observance of its highestlaws, as to appear before a higher judicial reason with perfectconfidence. On the contrary, it must renounce its magnificentdogmatical pretensions in philosophy.Very different is the case when it has to defend itself, not before ajudge, but against an equal. If dogmatical assertions are advanced onthe negative side, in opposition to those made by reason on thepositive side, its justification kat authrhopon is complete, althoughthe proof of its propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory.By the polemic of pure reason I mean the defence of its propositionsmade by reason, in opposition to the dogmatical counter-propositionsadvanced by other parties. The question here is not whether its ownstatements may not also be false; it merely regards the fact thatreason proves that the opposite cannot be established withdemonstrative certainty, nor even asserted with a higher degree ofprobability. Reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance; for,although she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them, no onecan prove that she is not the rightful possessor.It is a melancholy reflection that reason, in its highest exercise,falls into an antithetic; and that the supreme tribunal for thesettlement of differences should not be at union with itself. It istrue that we had to discuss the question of an apparent antithetic, butwe found that it was based upon a misconception. In conformity with thecommon prejudice, phenomena were regarded as things in themselves, andthus an absolute completeness in their synthesis was required in theone mode or in the other (it was shown to be impossible in both); ademand entirely out of place in regard to phenomena. There was, then,no real self-contradiction of reason in the propositions: The series ofphenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning; and:This series is absolutely and in itself without beginning. The twopropositions are perfectly consistent with each other, becausephenomena as phenomena are in themselves nothing, and consequently thehypothesis that they are things in themselves must lead toself-contradictory inferences.But there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot beprovided against, and the dispute must remain unsettled. Take, forexample, the theistic proposition: There is a Supreme Being; and on theother hand, the atheistic counter-statement: There exists no SupremeBeing; or, in psychology: Everything that thinks possesses theattribute of absolute and permanent unity, which is utterly differentfrom the transitory unity of material phenomena; and thecounter-proposition: The soul is not an immaterial unity, and itsnature is transitory, like that of phenomena. The objects of thesequestions contain no heterogeneous or contradictory elements, for theyrelate to things in themselves, and not to phenomena. There wouldarise, indeed, a real contradiction, if reason came forward with astatement on the negative side of these questions alone. As regards thecriticism to which the grounds of proof on the affirmative side must besubjected, it may be freely admitted, without necessitating thesurrender of the affirmative propositions, which have, at least, theinterest of reason in their favour—an advantage which the oppositeparty cannot lay claim to.I cannot agree with the opinion of several admirable thinkers—Sulzeramong the rest—that, in spite of the weakness of the arguments hithertoin use, we may hope, one day, to see sufficient demonstrations of thetwo cardinal propositions of pure reason—the existence of a SupremeBeing, and the immortality of the soul. I am certain, on the contrary,that this will never be the case. For on what ground can reason basesuch synthetical propositions, which do not relate to the objects ofexperience and their internal possibility? But it is alsodemonstratively certain that no one will ever be able to maintain thecontrary with the least show of probability. For, as he can attemptsuch a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason, he is bound to provethat a Supreme Being, and a thinking subject in the character of a pureintelligence, are impossible. But where will he find the knowledgewhich can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard tothings which transcend the region of experience? We may, therefore,rest assured that the opposite never will be demonstrated. We need not,then, have recourse to scholastic arguments; we may always admit thetruth of those propositions which are consistent with the speculativeinterests of reason in the sphere of experience, and form, moreover,the only means of uniting the speculative with the practical interest.Our opponent, who must not be considered here as a critic solely, wecan be ready to meet with a non liquet which cannot fail to disconcerthim; while we cannot deny his right to a similar retort, as we have onour side the advantage of the support of the subjective maxim ofreason, and can therefore look upon all his sophistical arguments withcalm indifference.From this point of view, there is properly no antithetic of purereason. For the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the fieldof pure theology and psychology; but on this ground there can appear nocombatant whom we need to fear. Ridicule and boasting can be his onlyweapons; and these may be laughed at, as mere child’s play. Thisconsideration restores to Reason her courage; for what source ofconfidence could be found, if she, whose vocation it is to destroyerror, were at variance with herself and without any reasonable hope ofever reaching a state of permanent repose?Everything in nature is good for some purpose. Even poisons areserviceable; they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generatedin our system, and must always find a place in every completepharmacopoeia. The objections raised against the fallacies andsophistries of speculative reason, are objections given by the natureof this reason itself, and must therefore have a destination andpurpose which can only be for the good of humanity. For what purposehas Providence raised many objects, in which we have the deepestinterest, so far above us, that we vainly try to cognize them withcertainty, and our powers of mental vision are rather excited thansatisfied by the glimpses we may chance to seize? It is very doubtfulwhether it is for our benefit to advance bold affirmations regardingsubjects involved in such obscurity; perhaps it would even bedetrimental to our best interests. But it is undoubtedly alwaysbeneficial to leave the investigating, as well as the critical reason,in perfect freedom, and permit it to take charge of its own interests,which are advanced as much by its limitation, as by its extension ofits views, and which always suffer by the interference of foreignpowers forcing it, against its natural tendencies, to bend to certainpreconceived designs.Allow your opponent to say what he thinks reasonable, and combat himonly with the weapons of reason. Have no anxiety for the practicalinterests of humanity—these are never imperilled in a purelyspeculative dispute. Such a dispute serves merely to disclose theantinomy of reason, which, as it has its source in the nature ofreason, ought to be thoroughly investigated. Reason is benefited by theexamination of a subject on both sides, and its judgements arecorrected by being limited. It is not the matter that may give occasionto dispute, but the manner. For it is perfectly permissible to employ,in the presence of reason, the language of a firmly rooted faith, evenafter we have been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge.If we were to ask the dispassionate David Hume—a philosopher endowed,in a degree that few are, with a well-balanced judgement: What motiveinduced you to spend so much labour and thought in undermining theconsoling and beneficial persuasion that reason is capable of assuringus of the existence, and presenting us with a determinate conception ofa Supreme Being?—his answer would be: Nothing but the desire ofteaching reason to know its own powers better, and, at the same time, adislike of the procedure by which that faculty was compelled to supportforegone conclusions, and prevented from confessing the internalweaknesses which it cannot but feel when it enters upon a rigidself-examination. If, on the other hand, we were to ask Priestley—aphilosopher who had no taste for transcendental speculation, but wasentirely devoted to the principles of empiricism—what his motives werefor overturning those two main pillars of religion—the doctrines of thefreedom of the will and the immortality of the soul (in his view thehope of a future life is but the expectation of the miracle ofresurrection)—this philosopher, himself a zealous and pious teacher ofreligion, could give no other answer than this: I acted in the interestof reason, which always suffers, when certain objects are explained andjudged by a reference to other supposed laws than those of materialnature—the only laws which we know in a determinate manner. It would beunfair to decry the latter philosopher, who endeavoured to harmonizehis paradoxical opinions with the interests of religion, and toundervalue an honest and reflecting man, because he finds himself at aloss the moment he has left the field of natural science. The samegrace must be accorded to Hume, a man not less well-disposed, and quiteas blameless in his moral character, and who pushed his abstractspeculations to an extreme length, because, as he rightly believed, theobject of them lies entirely beyond the bounds of natural science, andwithin the sphere of pure ideas.What is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in thepresent case to menace the best interests of humanity? The course to bepursued in reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and naturalone. Let each thinker pursue his own path; if he shows talent, if hegives evidence of profound thought, in one word, if he shows that hepossesses the power of reasoning—reason is always the gainer. If youhave recourse to other means, if you attempt to coerce reason, if youraise the cry of treason to humanity, if you excite the feelings of thecrowd, which can neither understand nor sympathize with such subtlespeculations—you will only make yourselves ridiculous. For the questiondoes not concern the advantage or disadvantage which we are expected toreap from such inquiries; the question is merely how far reason canadvance in the field of speculation, apart from all kinds of interest,and whether we may depend upon the exertions of speculative reason, ormust renounce all reliance on it. Instead of joining the combatants, itis your part to be a tranquil spectator of the struggle—a laboriousstruggle for the parties engaged, but attended, in its progress as wellas in its result, with the most advantageous consequences for theinterests of thought and knowledge. It is absurd to expect to beenlightened by Reason, and at the same time to prescribe to her whatside of the question she must adopt. Moreover, reason is sufficientlyheld in check by its own power, the limits imposed on it by its ownnature are sufficient; it is unnecessary for you to place over itadditional guards, as if its power were dangerous to the constitutionof the intellectual state. In the dialectic of reason there is novictory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility.The strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason, and we cannot butwish that it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedomwhich ought to be its essential condition. In this case, we should havehad at an earlier period a matured and profound criticism, which musthave put an end to all dialectical disputes, by exposing the illusionsand prejudices in which they originated.There is in human nature an unworthy propensity—a propensity which,like everything that springs from nature, must in its final purpose beconducive to the good of humanity—to conceal our real sentiments, andto give expression only to certain received opinions, which areregarded as at once safe and promotive of the common good. It is true,this tendency, not only to conceal our real sentiments, but to professthose which may gain us favour in the eyes of society, has not onlycivilized, but, in a certain measure, moralized us; as no one can breakthrough the outward covering of respectability, honour, and morality,and thus the seemingly-good examples which we see around us form anexcellent school for moral improvement, so long as our belief in theirgenuineness remains unshaken. But this disposition to representourselves as better than we are, and to utter opinions which are notour own, can be nothing more than a kind of provisionary arrangement ofnature to lead us from the rudeness of an uncivilized state, and toteach us how to assume at least the appearance and manner of the goodwe see. But when true principles have been developed, and have obtaineda sure foundation in our habit of thought, this conventionalism must beattacked with earnest vigour, otherwise it corrupts the heart, andchecks the growth of good dispositions with the mischievous weed offair appearances.I am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation andhypocrisy in the sphere of speculative discussion, where there is lesstemptation to restrain the free expression of thought. For what can bemore prejudicial to the interests of intelligence than to falsify ourreal sentiments, to conceal the doubts which we feel in regard to ourstatements, or to maintain the validity of grounds of proof which wewell know to be insufficient? So long as mere personal vanity is thesource of these unworthy artifices—and this is generally the case inspeculative discussions, which are mostly destitute of practicalinterest, and are incapable of complete demonstration—the vanity of theopposite party exaggerates as much on the other side; and thus theresult is the same, although it is not brought about so soon as if thedispute had been conducted in a sincere and upright spirit. But wherethe mass entertains the notion that the aim of certain subtlespeculators is nothing less than to shake the very foundations ofpublic welfare and morality—it seems not only prudent, but even praiseworthy, to maintain the good cause by illusory arguments, rather thanto give to our supposed opponents the advantage of lowering ourdeclarations to the moderate tone of a merely practical conviction, andof compelling us to confess our inability to attain to apodeicticcertainty in speculative subjects. But we ought to reflect that thereis nothing, in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good causethan deceit, misrepresentation, and falsehood. That the strictest lawsof honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculativesubject is the least requirement that can be made. If we could reckonwith security even upon so little, the conflict of speculative reasonregarding the important questions of God, immortality, and freedom,would have been either decided long ago, or would very soon be broughtto a conclusion. But, in general, the uprightness of the defence standsin an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause; and perhaps morehonesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than by those whouphold these doctrines.I shall persuade myself, then, that I have readers who do not wish tosee a righteous cause defended by unfair arguments. Such will nowrecognize the fact that, according to the principles of this Critique,if we consider not what is, but what ought to be the case, there can bereally no polemic of pure reason. For how can two persons dispute abouta thing, the reality of which neither can present in actual or even inpossible experience? Each adopts the plan of meditating on his idea forthe purpose of drawing from the idea, if he can, what is more than theidea, that is, the reality of the object which it indicates. How shallthey settle the dispute, since neither is able to make his assertionsdirectly comprehensible and certain, but must restrict himself toattacking and confuting those of his opponent? All statements enouncedby pure reason transcend the conditions of possible experience, beyondthe sphere of which we can discover no criterion of truth, while theyare at the same time framed in accordance with the laws of theunderstanding, which are applicable only to experience; and thus it isthe fate of all such speculative discussions that while the one partyattacks the weaker side of his opponent, he infallibly lays open hisown weaknesses.The critique of pure reason may be regarded as the highest tribunal forall speculative disputes; for it is not involved in these disputes,which have an immediate relation to certain objects and not to the lawsof the mind, but is instituted for the purpose of determining therights and limits of reason.Without the control of criticism, reason is, as it were, in a state ofnature, and can only establish its claims and assertions by war.Criticism, on the contrary, deciding all questions according to thefundamental laws of its own institution, secures to us the peace of lawand order, and enables us to discuss all differences in the moretranquil manner of a legal process. In the former case, disputes areended by victory, which both sides may claim and which is followed by ahollow armistice; in the latter, by a sentence, which, as it strikes atthe root of all speculative differences, ensures to all concerned alasting peace. The endless disputes of a dogmatizing reason compel usto look for some mode of arriving at a settled decision by a criticalinvestigation of reason itself; just as Hobbes maintains that the stateof nature is a state of injustice and violence, and that we must leaveit and submit ourselves to the constraint of law, which indeed limitsindividual freedom, but only that it may consist with the freedom ofothers and with the common good of all.This freedom will, among other things, permit of our openly stating thedifficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve, withoutbeing decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens. Thisprivilege forms part of the native rights of human reason, whichrecognizes no other judge than the universal reason of humanity; and asthis reason is the source of all progress and improvement, such aprivilege is to be held sacred and inviolable. It is unwise, moreover,to denounce as dangerous any bold assertions against, or rash attacksupon, an opinion which is held by the largest and most moral class ofthe community; for that would be giving them an importance which theydo not deserve. When I hear that the freedom of the will, the hope of afuture life, and the existence of God have been overthrown by thearguments of some able writer, I feel a strong desire to read his book;for I expect that he will add to my knowledge and impart greaterclearness and distinctness to my views by the argumentative power shownin his writings. But I am perfectly certain, even before I have openedthe book, that he has not succeeded in a single point, not because Ibelieve I am in possession of irrefutable demonstrations of theseimportant propositions, but because this transcendental critique, whichhas disclosed to me the power and the limits of pure reason, has fullyconvinced me that, as it is insufficient to establish the affirmative,it is as powerless, and even more so, to assure us of the truth of thenegative answer to these questions. From what source does thisfree-thinker derive his knowledge that there is, for example, noSupreme Being? This proposition lies out of the field of possibleexperience, and, therefore, beyond the limits of human cognition. But Iwould not read at, all the answer which the dogmatical maintainer ofthe good cause makes to his opponent, because I know well beforehand,that he will merely attack the fallacious grounds of his adversary,without being able to establish his own assertions. Besides, a newillusory argument, in the construction of which talent and acutenessare shown, is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning, andin this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless.Again, the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment tocriticism, and enables us to test and correct its principles, whilethere is no occasion for anxiety in regard to the influence and resultsof his reasoning.But, it will be said, must we not warn the youth entrusted toacademical care against such writings, must we not preserve them fromthe knowledge of these dangerous assertions, until their judgement isripened, or rather until the doctrines which we wish to inculcate areso firmly rooted in their minds as to withstand all attempts atinstilling the contrary dogmas, from whatever quarter they may come?If we are to confine ourselves to the dogmatical procedure in thesphere of pure reason, and find ourselves unable to settle suchdisputes otherwise than by becoming a party in them, and settingcounter-assertions against the statements advanced by our opponents,there is certainly no plan more advisable for the moment, but, at thesame time, none more absurd and inefficient for the future, than thisretaining of the youthful mind under guardianship for a time, and thuspreserving it—for so long at least—from seduction into error. But when,at a later period, either curiosity, or the prevalent fashion ofthought places such writings in their hands, will the so-calledconvictions of their youth stand firm? The young thinker, who has inhis armoury none but dogmatical weapons with which to resist theattacks of his opponent, and who cannot detect the latent dialecticwhich lies in his own opinions as well as in those of the oppositeparty, sees the advance of illusory arguments and grounds of proofwhich have the advantage of novelty, against as illusory grounds ofproof destitute of this advantage, and which, perhaps, excite thesuspicion that the natural credulity of his youth has been abused byhis instructors. He thinks he can find no better means of showing thathe has out grown the discipline of his minority than by despising thosewell-meant warnings, and, knowing no system of thought but that ofdogmatism, he drinks deep draughts of the poison that is to sap theprinciples in which his early years were trained.Exactly the opposite of the system here recommended ought to be pursuedin academical instruction. This can only be effected, however, by athorough training in the critical investigation of pure reason. For, inorder to bring the principles of this critique into exercise as soon aspossible, and to demonstrate their perfect even in the presence of thehighest degree of dialectical illusion, the student ought to examinethe assertions made on both sides of speculative questions step bystep, and to test them by these principles. It cannot be a difficulttask for him to show the fallacies inherent in these propositions, andthus he begins early to feel his own power of securing himself againstthe influence of such sophistical arguments, which must finally lose,for him, all their illusory power. And, although the same blows whichoverturn the edifice of his opponent are as fatal to his ownspeculative structures, if such he has wished to rear; he need not feelany sorrow in regard to this seeming misfortune, as he has now beforehim a fair prospect into the practical region in which he mayreasonably hope to find a more secure foundation for a rational system.There is, accordingly, no proper polemic in the sphere of pure reason.Both parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows, as theypass beyond the limits of nature, and can find no tangible point ofattack—no firm footing for their dogmatical conflict. Fight asvigorously as they may, the shadows which they hew down, immediatelystart up again, like the heroes in Walhalla, and renew the bloodlessand unceasing contest.But neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employmentof pure reason, such as might be based upon the principle of neutralityin all speculative disputes. To excite reason against itself, to placeweapons in the hands of the party on the one side as well as in thoseof the other, and to remain an undisturbed and sarcastic spectator ofthe fierce struggle that ensues, seems, from the dogmatical point ofview, to be a part fitting only a malevolent disposition. But, when thesophist evidences an invincible obstinacy and blindness, and a pridewhich no criticism can moderate, there is no other practicable coursethan to oppose to this pride and obstinacy similar feelings andpretensions on the other side, equally well or ill founded, so thatreason, staggered by the reflections thus forced upon it, finds itnecessary to moderate its confidence in such pretensions and to listento the advice of criticism. But we cannot stop at these doubts, muchless regard the conviction of our ignorance, not only as a cure for theconceit natural to dogmatism, but as the settlement of the disputes inwhich reason is involved with itself. On the contrary, scepticism ismerely a means of awakening reason from its dogmatic dreams andexciting it to a more careful investigation into its own powers andpretensions. But, as scepticism appears to be the shortest road to apermanent peace in the domain of philosophy, and as it is the trackpursued by the many who aim at giving a philosophical colouring totheir contemptuous dislike of all inquiries of this kind, I think itnecessary to present to my readers this mode of thought in its truelight._Scepticism not a Permanent State for Human Reason._The consciousness of ignorance—unless this ignorance is recognized tobe absolutely necessary ought, instead of forming the conclusion of myinquiries, to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them. Allignorance is either ignorance of things or of the limits of knowledge.If my ignorance is accidental and not necessary, it must incite me, inthe first case, to a dogmatical inquiry regarding the objects of whichI am ignorant; in the second, to a critical investigation into thebounds of all possible knowledge. But that my ignorance is absolutelynecessary and unavoidable, and that it consequently absolves from theduty of all further investigation, is a fact which cannot be made outupon empirical grounds—from observation—but upon critical groundsalone, that is, by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primarysources of cognition. It follows that the determination of the boundsof reason can be made only on à priori grounds; while the empiricallimitation of reason, which is merely an indeterminate cognition of anignorance that can never be completely removed, can take place only àposteriori. In other words, our empirical knowledge is limited by thatwhich yet remains for us to know. The former cognition of ourignorance, which is possible only on a rational basis, is a science;the latter is merely a perception, and we cannot say how far theinferences drawn from it may extend. If I regard the earth, as itreally appears to my senses, as a flat surface, I am ignorant how farthis surface extends. But experience teaches me that, how far soever Igo, I always see before me a space in which I can proceed farther; andthus I know the limits—merely visual—of my actual knowledge of theearth, although I am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself. But ifI have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere, and that itssurface is spherical, I can cognize à priori and determine uponprinciples, from my knowledge of a small part of this surface—say tothe extent of a degree—the diameter and circumference of the earth; andalthough I am ignorant of the objects which this surface contains, Ihave a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent.The sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to bea level surface, with an apparent horizon—that which forms the limit ofits extent, and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditionedtotality. To reach this limit by empirical means is impossible, and allattempts to determine it à priori according to a principle, are alikein vain. But all the questions raised by pure reason relate to thatwhich lies beyond this horizon, or, at least, in its boundary line.The celebrated David Hume was one of those geographers of human reasonwho believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all suchquestions by declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of ourknowledge—a horizon which, however, Hume was unable to determine. Hisattention especially was directed to the principle of causality; and heremarked with perfect justice that the truth of this principle, andeven the objective validity of the conception of a cause, was notcommonly based upon clear insight, that is, upon à priori cognition.Hence he concluded that this law does not derive its authority from itsuniversality and necessity, but merely from its general applicabilityin the course of experience, and a kind of subjective necessity thencearising, which he termed habit. From the inability of reason toestablish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of allexperience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason topass the region of the empirical.This procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination, and,if necessary, to disapproval, may be termed the censura of reason. Thiscensura must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendentemployment of principles. But this is only the second step in ourinquiry. The first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason, andwhich marks the infancy of that faculty, is that of dogmatism. Thesecond, which we have just mentioned, is that of scepticism, and itgives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience. Buta third step is necessary—indicative of the maturity and manhood of thejudgement, which now lays a firm foundation upon universal andnecessary principles. This is the period of criticism, in which we donot examine the facta of reason, but reason itself, in the whole extentof its powers, and in regard to its capability of à priori cognition;and thus we determine not merely the empirical and ever-shifting boundsof our knowledge, but its necessary and eternal limits. We demonstratefrom indubitable principles, not merely our ignorance in respect tothis or that subject, but in regard to all possible questions of acertain class. Thus scepticism is a resting place for reason, in whichit may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings and gain some knowledge ofthe region in which it happens to be, that it may pursue its way withgreater certainty; but it cannot be its permanent dwelling-place. Itmust take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude,whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves, or to thelimits which bound all our cognition.Reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane, ofthe bounds of which we have only a general knowledge; it ought ratherto be compared to a sphere, the radius of which may be found from thecurvature of its surface—that is, the nature of à priori syntheticalpropositions—and, consequently, its circumference and extent. Beyondthe sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize;nay, even questions regarding such supposititious objects relate onlyto the subjective principles of a complete determination of therelations which exist between the understanding-conceptions which liewithin this sphere.We are actually in possession of à priori synthetical cognitions, as isproved by the existence of the principles of the understanding, whichanticipate experience. If any one cannot comprehend the possibility ofthese principles, he may have some reason to doubt whether they arereally à priori; but he cannot on this account declare them to beimpossible, and affirm the nullity of the steps which reason may havetaken under their guidance. He can only say: If we perceived theirorigin and their authenticity, we should be able to determine theextent and limits of reason; but, till we can do this, all propositionsregarding the latter are mere random assertions. In this view, thedoubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy, which proceeds without theguidance of criticism, is well grounded; but we cannot therefore denyto reason the ability to construct a sound philosophy, when the way hasbeen prepared by a thorough critical investigation. All the conceptionsproduced, and all the questions raised, by pure reason, do not lie inthe sphere of experience, but in that of reason itself, and hence theymust be solved, and shown to be either valid or inadmissible, by thatfaculty. We have no right to decline the solution of such problems, onthe ground that the solution can be discovered only from the nature ofthings, and under pretence of the limitation of human faculties, forreason is the sole creator of all these ideas, and is therefore boundeither to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature.The polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist,who erects a system of philosophy without having examined thefundamental objective principles on which it is based, for the purposeof evidencing the futility of his designs, and thus bringing him to aknowledge of his own powers. But, in itself, scepticism does not giveus any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge.All unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia, which it isalways useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic. But this cannothelp us to any decision regarding the expectations which reasoncherishes of better success in future endeavours; the investigations ofscepticism cannot, therefore, settle the dispute regarding the rightsand powers of human reason.Hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all scepticalphilosophers, and his writings have, undoubtedly, exerted the mostpowerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation intoits own powers. It will, therefore, well repay our labours to considerfor a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errorsinto which he strayed, although setting out on the path of truth andcertitude.Hume was probably aware, although he never clearly developed thenotion, that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond ourconception of the object. I have termed this kind of judgementsynthetical. As regard the manner in which I pass beyond my conceptionby the aid of experience, no doubts can be entertained. Experience isitself a synthesis of perceptions; and it employs perceptions toincrement the conception, which I obtain by means of anotherperception. But we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond aconception, and to extend our cognition à priori. We attempt this intwo ways—either, through the pure understanding, in relation to thatwhich may become an object of experience, or, through pure reason, inrelation to such properties of things, or of the existence of things,as can never be presented in any experience. This sceptical philosopherdid not distinguish these two kinds of judgements, as he ought to havedone, but regarded this augmentation of conceptions, and, if we may soexpress ourselves, the spontaneous generation of understanding andreason, independently of the impregnation of experience, as altogetherimpossible. The so-called à priori principles of these faculties heconsequently held to be invalid and imaginary, and regarded them asnothing but subjective habits of thought originating in experience, andtherefore purely empirical and contingent rules, to which we attributea spurious necessity and universality. In support of this strangeassertion, he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle ofthe relation between cause and effect. No faculty of the mind canconduct us from the conception of a thing to the existence of somethingelse; and hence he believed he could infer that, without experience, wepossess no source from which we can augment a conception, and no groundsufficient to justify us in framing a judgement that is to extend ourcognition à priori. That the light of the sun, which shines upon apiece of wax, at the same time melts it, while it hardens clay, nopower of the understanding could infer from the conceptions which wepreviously possessed of these substances; much less is there any àpriori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion, which experiencealone can certify. On the other hand, we have seen in our discussion oftranscendental logic, that, although we can never proceed immediatelybeyond the content of the conception which is given us, we can alwayscognize completely à priori—in relation, however, to a third term,namely, possible experience—the law of its connection with otherthings. For example, if I observe that a piece of wax melts, I cancognize à priori that there must have been something (the sun’s heat)preceding, which this law; although, without the aid of experience, Icould not cognize à priori and in a determinate manner either the causefrom the effect, or the effect from the cause. Hume was, therefore,wrong in inferring, from the contingency of the determination accordingto law, the contingency of the law itself; and the passing beyond theconception of a thing to possible experience (which is an à prioriproceeding, constituting the objective reality of the conception), heconfounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience, which isalways, of course, empirical. Thus, too, he regarded the principle ofaffinity, which has its seat in the understanding and indicates anecessary connection, as a mere rule of association, lying in theimitative faculty of imagination, which can present only contingent,and not objective connections.The sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principallyfrom a defect, which was common to him with the dogmatists, namely,that he had never made a systematic review of all the different kindsof à priori synthesis performed by the understanding. Had he done so,he would have found, to take one example among many, that the principleof permanence was of this character, and that it, as well as theprinciple of causality, anticipates experience. In this way he mighthave been able to describe the determinate limits of the à priorioperations of understanding and reason. But he merely declared theunderstanding to be limited, instead of showing what its limits were;he created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties, withoutgiving us any determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary andunavoidable ignorance; he examined and condemned some of the principlesof the understanding, without investigating all its powers with thecompleteness necessary to criticism. He denies, with truth, certainpowers to the understanding, but he goes further, and declares it to beutterly inadequate to the à priori extension of knowledge, although hehas not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty; andthus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too. That isto say, his own declarations are doubted, for his objections were basedupon facta, which are contingent, and not upon principles, which canalone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmaticalassertions.As Hume makes no distinction between the well-grounded claims of theunderstanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason, against which,however, his attacks are mainly directed, reason does not feel itselfshut out from all attempts at the extension of à priori cognition, andhence it refuses, in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter, torelinquish such efforts. For one naturally arms oneself to resist anattack, and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish theclaims he has advanced. But a complete review of the powers of reason,and the conviction thence arising that we are in possession of alimited field of action, while we must admit the vanity of higherclaims, puts an end to all doubt and dispute, and induces reason torest satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain.To the uncritical dogmatist, who has not surveyed the sphere of hisunderstanding, nor determined, in accordance with principles, thelimits of possible cognition, who, consequently, is ignorant of his ownpowers, and believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes inthe field of cognition, these attacks of scepticism are not onlydangerous, but destructive. For if there is one proposition in hischain of reasoning which he cannot prove, or the fallacy in which hecannot evolve in accordance with a principle, suspicion falls on allhis statements, however plausible they may appear.And thus scepticism, the bane of dogmatical philosophy, conducts us toa sound investigation into the understanding and the reason. When weare thus far advanced, we need fear no further attacks; for the limitsof our domain are clearly marked out, and we can make no claims norbecome involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyondthese limits. Thus the sceptical procedure in philosophy does notpresent any solution of the problems of reason, but it forms anexcellent exercise for its powers, awakening its circumspection, andindicating the means whereby it may most fully establish its claims toits legitimate possessions.Section III. The Discipline of Pure Reason in HypothesisThis critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts toextend the bounds of knowledge, by means of pure speculation, areutterly fruitless. So much the wider field, it may appear, lies open tohypothesis; as, where we cannot know with certainty, we are at libertyto make guesses and to form suppositions.Imagination may be allowed, under the strict surveillance of reason, toinvent suppositions; but, these must be based on something that isperfectly certain—and that is the possibility of the object. If we arewell assured upon this point, it is allowable to have recourse tosupposition in regard to the reality of the object; but thissupposition must, unless it is utterly groundless, be connected, as itsground of explanation, with that which is really given and absolutelycertain. Such a supposition is termed a hypothesis.It is beyond our power to form the least conception à priori of thepossibility of dynamical connection in phenomena; and the category ofthe pure understanding will not enable us to excogitate any suchconnection, but merely helps us to understand it, when we meet with itin experience. For this reason we cannot, in accordance with thecategories, imagine or invent any object or any property of an objectnot given, or that may not be given in experience, and employ it in ahypothesis; otherwise, we should be basing our chain of reasoning uponmere chimerical fancies, and not upon conceptions of things. Thus, wehave no right to assume the existence of new powers, not existing innature—for example, an understanding with a non-sensuous intuition, aforce of attraction without contact, or some new kind of substancesoccupying space, and yet without the property of impenetrability—and,consequently, we cannot assume that there is any other kind ofcommunity among substances than that observable in experience, any kindof presence than that in space, or any kind of duration than that intime. In one word, the conditions of possible experience are for reasonthe only conditions of the possibility of things; reason cannot ventureto form, independently of these conditions, any conceptions of things,because such conceptions, although not self-contradictory, are withoutobject and without application.The conceptions of reason are, as we have already shown, mere ideas,and do not relate to any object in any kind of experience. At the sametime, they do not indicate imaginary or possible objects. They arepurely problematical in their nature and, as aids to the heuristicexercise of the faculties, form the basis of the regulative principlesfor the systematic employment of the understanding in the field ofexperience. If we leave this ground of experience, they become merefictions of thought, the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable;and they cannot, consequently, be employed as hypotheses in theexplanation of real phenomena. It is quite admissible to cogitate thesoul as simple, for the purpose of enabling ourselves to employ theidea of a perfect and necessary unity of all the faculties of the mindas the principle of all our inquiries into its internal phenomena,although we cannot cognize this unity in concreto. But to assume thatthe soul is a simple substance (a transcendental conception) would beenouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrable—as manyphysical hypotheses are—but a proposition which is purely arbitrary,and in the highest degree rash. The simple is never presented inexperience; and, if by substance is here meant the permanent object ofsensuous intuition, the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectlyinconceivable. Reason affords no good grounds for admitting theexistence of intelligible beings, or of intelligible properties ofsensuous things, although—as we have no conception either of theirpossibility or of their impossibility—it will always be out of ourpower to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist. In the explanationof given phenomena, no other things and no other grounds of explanationcan be employed than those which stand in connection with the givenphenomena according to the known laws of experience. A transcendentalhypothesis, in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain thephenomena of nature, would not give us any better insight into aphenomenon, as we should be trying to explain what we do notsufficiently understand from known empirical principles, by what we donot understand at all. The principles of such a hypothesis mightconduce to the satisfaction of reason, but it would not assist theunderstanding in its application to objects. Order and conformity toaims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon naturalgrounds and according to natural laws; and the wildest hypotheses, ifthey are only physical, are here more admissible than a hyperphysicalhypothesis, such as that of a divine author. For such a hypothesiswould introduce the principle of ignava ratio, which requires us togive up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course ofexperience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea. As regards theabsolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of thesecauses, this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case ofphenomena; because, as they are to us nothing more than phenomena, wehave no right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesisof the series of their conditions.Transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible; and we cannot usethe liberty of employing, in the absence of physical, hyperphysicalgrounds of explanation. And this for two reasons; first, because suchhypothesis do not advance reason, but rather stop it in its progress;secondly, because this licence would render fruitless all its exertionsin its own proper sphere, which is that of experience. For, when theexplanation of natural phenomena happens to be difficult, we haveconstantly at hand a transcendental ground of explanation, which liftsus above the necessity of investigating nature; and our inquiries arebrought to a close, not because we have obtained all the requisiteknowledge, but because we abut upon a principle which isincomprehensible and which, indeed, is so far back in the track ofthought as to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being.The next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is itssufficiency. That is, it must determine à priori the consequences whichare given in experience and which are supposed to follow from thehypothesis itself. If we require to employ auxiliary hypotheses, thesuspicion naturally arises that they are mere fictions; because thenecessity for each of them requires the same justification as in thecase of the original hypothesis, and thus their testimony is invalid.If we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect cause, we possesssufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to aims, theorder and the greatness which we observe in the universe; but we findourselves obliged, when we observe the evil in the world and theexceptions to these laws, to employ new hypothesis in support of theoriginal one. We employ the idea of the simple nature of the human soulas the foundation of all the theories we may form of its phenomena; butwhen we meet with difficulties in our way, when we observe in the soulphenomena similar to the changes which take place in matter, we requireto call in new auxiliary hypotheses. These may, indeed, not be false,but we do not know them to be true, because the only witness to theircertitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called into explain.We are not discussing the above-mentioned assertions regarding theimmaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a Supreme Being asdogmata, which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate à priori,but purely as hypotheses. In the former case, the dogmatist must takecare that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of ademonstration. For the assertion that the reality of such ideas isprobable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition ingeometry. Pure abstract reason, apart from all experience, can eithercognize nothing at all; and hence the judgements it enounces are nevermere opinions, they are either apodeictic certainties, or declarationsthat nothing can be known on the subject. Opinions and probablejudgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explaingiven phenomena, or they may relate to the effect, in accordance withempirical laws, of an actually existing cause. In other words, we mustrestrict the sphere of opinion to the world of experience and nature.Beyond this region opinion is mere invention; unless we are gropingabout for the truth on a path not yet fully known, and have some hopesof stumbling upon it by chance.But, although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questionsof pure speculative reason, they may be employed in the defence ofthese answers. That is to say, hypotheses are admissible in polemic,but not in the sphere of dogmatism. By the defence of statements ofthis character, I do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds fortheir support, but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents.All à priori synthetical propositions possess the peculiarity that,although the philosopher who maintains the reality of the ideascontained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficientknowledge to establish the certainty of his statements, his opponent isas little able to prove the truth of the opposite. This equality offortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in thesphere of speculative cognition; and it is this sphere, accordingly,that is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts. But weshall afterwards show that, in relation to its practical exercise,Reason has the right of admitting what, in the field of purespeculation, she would not be justified in supposing, except uponperfectly sufficient grounds; because all such suppositions destroy thenecessary completeness of speculation—a condition which the practicalreason, however, does not consider to be requisite. In this sphere,therefore, Reason is mistress of a possession, her title to which shedoes not require to prove—which, in fact, she could not do. The burdenof proof accordingly rests upon the opponent. But as he has just aslittle knowledge regarding the subject discussed, and is as little ableto prove the non-existence of the object of an idea, as the philosopheron the other side is to demonstrate its reality, it is evident thatthere is an advantage on the side of the philosopher who maintains hisproposition as a practically necessary supposition (melior est conditiopossidentis). For he is at liberty to employ, in self-defence, the sameweapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking him; that is, he hasa right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of supporting thearguments in favour of his own propositions, but to show that hisopponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject underdiscussion and cannot boast of any speculative advantage.Hypotheses are, therefore, admissible in the sphere of pure reason onlyas weapons for self-defence, and not as supports to dogmaticalassertions. But the opposing party we must always seek for inourselves. For speculative reason is, in the sphere oftranscendentalism, dialectical in its own nature. The difficulties andobjections we have to fear lie in ourselves. They are like old butnever superannuated claims; and we must seek them out, and settle themonce and for ever, if we are to expect a permanent peace. Externaltranquility is hollow and unreal. The root of these contradictions,which lies in the nature of human reason, must be destroyed; and thiscan only be done by giving it, in the first instance, freedom to grow,nay, by nourishing it, that it may send out shoots, and thus betray itsown existence. It is our duty, therefore, to try to discover newobjections, to put weapons in the bands of our opponent, and to granthim the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish. We havenothing to fear from these concessions; on the contrary, we may ratherhope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which noone will ever venture to dispute.The thinker requires, to be fully equipped, the hypotheses of purereason, which, although but leaden weapons (for they have not beensteeled in the armoury of experience), are as useful as any that can beemployed by his opponents. If, accordingly, we have assumed, from anon-speculative point of view, the immaterial nature of the soul, andare met by the objection that experience seems to prove that the growthand decay of our mental faculties are mere modifications of thesensuous organism—we can weaken the force of this objection by theassumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental phenomenon, towhich, as a necessary condition, all sensibility, and consequently allthought, relates in the present state of our existence; and that theseparation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuousexercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of theintellectual. The body would, in this view of the question, beregarded, not as the cause of thought, but merely as its restrictivecondition, as promotive of the sensuous and animal, but as a hindranceto the pure and spiritual life; and the dependence of the animal lifeon the constitution of the body, would not prove that the whole life ofman was also dependent on the state of the organism. We might go stillfarther, and discover new objections, or carry out to their extremeconsequences those which have already been adduced.Generation, in the human race as well as among the irrational animals,depends on so many accidents—of occasion, of proper sustenance, of thelaws enacted by the government of a country of vice even, that it isdifficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life hasbegun under circumstances so mean and trivial, and so entirelydependent upon our own control. As regards the continuance of theexistence of the whole race, we need have no difficulties, for accidentin single cases is subject to general laws; but, in the case of eachindividual, it would seem as if we could hardly expect so wonderful aneffect from causes so insignificant. But, in answer to theseobjections, we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all lifeis properly intelligible, and not subject to changes of time, and thatit neither began in birth, nor will end in death. We may assume thatthis life is nothing more than a sensuous representation of purespiritual life; that the whole world of sense is but an image, hoveringbefore the faculty of cognition which we exercise in this sphere, andwith no more objective reality than a dream; and that if we couldintuite ourselves and other things as they really are, we should seeourselves in a world of spiritual natures, our connection with whichdid not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction ofthe body. And so on.We cannot be said to know what has been above asserted, nor do weseriously maintain the truth of these assertions; and the notionstherein indicated are not even ideas of reason, they are purelyfictitious conceptions. But this hypothetical procedure is in perfectconformity with the laws of reason. Our opponent mistakes the absenceof empirical conditions for a proof of the complete impossibility ofall that we have asserted; and we have to show him that he has notexhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as littlecompass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature, as we can laya secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region ofexperience. Such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of anopponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion. Thephilosopher abandons them, so soon as the opposite party renounces itsdogmatical conceit. To maintain a simply negative position in relationto propositions which rest on an insecure foundation, well befits themoderation of a true philosopher; but to uphold the objections urgedagainst an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a proceedingjust as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position of aphilosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such asubject.It is evident, therefore, that hypotheses, in the speculative sphere,are valid, not as independent propositions, but only relatively toopposite transcendent assumptions. For, to make the principles ofpossible experience conditions of the possibility of things in generalis just as transcendent a procedure as to maintain the objectivereality of ideas which can be applied to no objects except such as liewithout the limits of possible experience. The judgements enounced bypure reason must be necessary, or they must not be enounced at all.Reason cannot trouble herself with opinions. But the hypotheses we havebeen discussing are merely problematical judgements, which can neitherbe confuted nor proved; while, therefore, they are not personalopinions, they are indispensable as answers to objections which areliable to be raised. But we must take care to confine them to thisfunction, and guard against any assumption on their part of absolutevalidity, a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricabledifficulties and contradictions.Section IV. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Relation to ProofsIt is a peculiarity, which distinguishes the proofs of transcendentalsynthetical propositions from those of all other à priori syntheticalcognitions, that reason, in the case of the former, does not apply itsconceptions directly to an object, but is first obliged to prove, àpriori, the objective validity of these conceptions and the possibilityof their syntheses. This is not merely a prudential rule, it isessential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendentalproposition. If I am required to pass, à priori, beyond the conceptionof an object, I find that it is utterly impossible without the guidanceof something which is not contained in the conception. In mathematics,it is à priori intuition that guides my synthesis; and, in this case,all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition. Intranscendental cognition, so long as we are dealing only withconceptions of the understanding, we are guided by possible experience.That is to say, a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition doesnot show that the given conception (that of an event, for example)leads directly to another conception (that of a cause)—for this wouldbe a saltus which nothing can justify; but it shows that experienceitself, and consequently the object of experience, is impossiblewithout the connection indicated by these conceptions. It follows thatsuch a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving,synthetically and à priori, at a certain knowledge of things, which wasnot contained in our conceptions of these things. Unless we payparticular attention to this requirement, our proofs, instead ofpursuing the straight path indicated by reason, follow the tortuousroad of mere subjective association. The illusory conviction, whichrests upon subjective causes of association, and which is considered asresulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity,is always open to doubt and suspicion. For this reason, all theattempts which have been made to prove the principle of sufficientreason, have, according to the universal admission of philosophers,been quite unsuccessful; and, before the appearance of transcendentalcriticism, it was considered better, as this principle could not beabandoned, to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind (aproceeding which always proves that the problem, which reason ought tosolve, is one in which philosophers find great difficulties), ratherthan attempt to discover new dogmatical proofs.But, if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason,and if I aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid ofmere ideas, it is necessary that the proof should first show that sucha step in synthesis is possible (which it is not), before it proceedsto prove the truth of the proposition itself. The so-called proof ofthe simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception, is a veryplausible one. But it contains no answer to the objection, that, as thenotion of absolute simplicity is not a conception which is directlyapplicable to a perception, but is an idea which must be inferred—if atall—from observation, it is by no means evident how the mere fact ofconsciousness, which is contained in all thought, although in so far asimple representation, can conduct me to the consciousness andcognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance. When Irepresent to my mind the power of my body as in motion, my body in thisthought is so far absolute unity, and my representation of it is asimple one; and hence I can indicate this representation by the motionof a point, because I have made abstraction of the size or volume ofthe body. But I cannot hence infer that, given merely the moving powerof a body, the body may be cogitated as simple substance, merelybecause the representation in my mind takes no account of its contentin space, and is consequently simple. The simple, in abstraction, isvery different from the objectively simple; and hence the Ego, which issimple in the first sense, may, in the second sense, as indicating thesoul itself, be a very complex conception, with a very various content.Thus it is evident that in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism.We guess (for without some such surmise our suspicion would not beexcited in reference to a proof of this character) at the presence ofthe paralogism, by keeping ever before us a criterion of thepossibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at proving morethan experience can teach us. This criterion is obtained from theobservation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subjectof the proposition to be proved to the required predicate, but find itnecessary to presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition àpriori by means of ideas. We must, accordingly, always use the greatestcaution; we require, before attempting any proof, to consider how it ispossible to extend the sphere of cognition by the operations of purereason, and from what source we are to derive knowledge, which is notobtained from the analysis of conceptions, nor relates, byanticipation, to possible experience. We shall thus spare ourselvesmuch severe and fruitless labour, by not expecting from reason what isbeyond its power, or rather by subjecting it to discipline, andteaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of thesphere of cognition.The first rule for our guidance is, therefore, not to attempt atranscendental proof, before we have considered from what source we areto derive the principles upon which the proof is to be based, and whatright we have to expect that our conclusions from these principles willbe veracious. If they are principles of the understanding, it is vainto expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason;for these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possibleexperience. If they are principles of pure reason, our labour is alikein vain. For the principles of reason, if employed as objective, arewithout exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth, exceptas regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason inexperience. But when such delusive proof are presented to us, it is ourduty to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement; and,although we are unable to expose the particular sophism upon which theproof is based, we have a right to demand a deduction of the principlesemployed in it; and, if these principles have their origin in purereason alone, such a deduction is absolutely impossible. And thus it isunnecessary that we should trouble ourselves with the exposure andconfutation of every sophistical illusion; we may, at once, bring alldialectic, which is inexhaustible in the production of fallacies,before the bar of critical reason, which tests the principles uponwhich all dialectical procedure is based. The second peculiarity oftranscendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot restupon more than a single proof. If I am drawing conclusions, not fromconceptions, but from intuition corresponding to a conception, be itpure intuition, as in mathematics, or empirical, as in natural science,the intuition which forms the basis of my inferences presents me withmaterials for many synthetical propositions, which I can connect invarious modes, while, as it is allowable to proceed from differentpoints in the intention, I can arrive by different paths at the sameproposition.But every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception, andposits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an objectaccording to this conception. There must, therefore, be but one groundof proof, because it is the conception alone which determines theobject; and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than thedetermination of the object according to the conception. In ourTranscendental Analytic, for example, we inferred the principle: Everyevent has a cause, from the only condition of the objective possibilityof our conception of an event. This is that an event cannot bedetermined in time, and consequently cannot form a part of experience,unless it stands under this dynamical law. This is the only possibleground of proof; for our conception of an event possesses objectivevalidity, that is, is a true conception, only because the law ofcausality determines an object to which it can refer. Other argumentsin support of this principle have been attempted—such as that from thecontingent nature of a phenomenon; but when this argument isconsidered, we can discover no criterion of contingency, except thefact of an event—of something happening, that is to say, the existencewhich is preceded by the non-existence of an object, and thus we fallback on the very thing to be proved. If the proposition: “Everythinking being is simple,” is to be proved, we keep to the conceptionof the ego, which is simple, and to which all thought has a relation.The same is the case with the transcendental proof of the existence ofa Deity, which is based solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitnessof the conceptions of an ens realissimum and a necessary being, andcannot be attempted in any other manner.This caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of allpropositions of reason. When reason employs conceptions alone, only oneproof of its thesis is possible, if any. When, therefore, the dogmatistadvances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition, we may be surethat not one of them is conclusive. For if he possessed one whichproved the proposition he brings forward to demonstration—as mustalways be the case with the propositions of pure reason—what need isthere for any more? His intention can only be similar to that of theadvocate who had different arguments for different judges; thisavailing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments,who, without going into any profound investigation, adopt the view ofthe case which seems most probable at first sight and decide accordingto it.The third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of aproof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic orindirect, but always ostensive or direct. The direct or ostensive proofnot only establishes the truth of the proposition to be proved, butexposes the grounds of its truth; the apagogic, on the other hand, mayassure us of the truth of the proposition, but it cannot enable us tocomprehend the grounds of its possibility. The latter is, accordingly,rather an auxiliary to an argument, than a strictly philosophical andrational mode of procedure. In one respect, however, they have anadvantage over direct proofs, from the fact that the mode of arguing bycontradiction, which they employ, renders our understanding of thequestion more clear, and approximates the proof to the certainty of anintuitional demonstration.The true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciencesis this. When the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition aretoo various or too profound, we try whether or not we may not discoverthe truth of our cognition from its consequences. The modus ponens ofreasoning from the truth of its inferences to the truth of aproposition would be admissible if all the inferences that can be drawnfrom it are known to be true; for in this case there can be only onepossible ground for these inferences, and that is the true one. Butthis is a quite impracticable procedure, as it surpasses all our powersto discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from aproposition. But this mode of reasoning is employed, under favour, whenwe wish to prove the truth of an hypothesis; in which case we admit thetruth of the conclusion—which is supported by analogy—that, if all theinferences we have drawn and examined agree with the propositionassumed, all other possible inferences will also agree with it. But, inthis way, an hypothesis can never be established as a demonstratedtruth. The modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to theunknown proposition, is not only a rigorous, but a very easy mode ofproof. For, if it can be shown that but one inference from aproposition is false, then the proposition must itself be false.Instead, then, of examining, in an ostensive argument, the whole seriesof the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests, we need onlytake the opposite of this proposition, and if one inference from it befalse, then must the opposite be itself false; and, consequently, theproposition which we wished to prove must be true.The apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences whereit is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for anobjective cognition. Where this is possible, it is plain that theopposite of a given proposition may contradict merely the subjectiveconditions of thought, and not the objective cognition; or it mayhappen that both propositions contradict each other only under asubjective condition, which is incorrectly considered to be objective,and, as the condition is itself false, both propositions may be false,and it will, consequently, be impossible to conclude the truth of theone from the falseness of the other.In mathematics such subreptions are impossible; and it is in thisscience, accordingly, that the indirect mode of proof has its trueplace. In the science of nature, where all assertion is based uponempirical intuition, such subreptions may be guarded against by therepeated comparison of observations; but this mode of proof is oflittle value in this sphere of knowledge. But the transcendentalefforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the subjective,which is the real medium of all dialectical illusion; and thus reasonendeavours, in its premisses, to impose upon us subjectiverepresentations for objective cognitions. In the transcendental sphereof pure reason, then, and in the case of synthetical propositions, itis inadmissible to support a statement by disproving thecounter-statement. For only two cases are possible; either, thecounter-statement is nothing but the enouncement of the inconsistencyof the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of reason, whichdoes not affect the real case (for example, we cannot comprehend theunconditioned necessity of the existence of a being, and hence everyspeculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed onsubjective grounds, while the possibility of this being in itselfcannot with justice be denied); or, both propositions, beingdialectical in their nature, are based upon an impossible conception.In this latter case the rule applies: non entis nulla sunt predicata;that is to say, what we affirm and what we deny, respecting such anobject, are equally untrue, and the apagogic mode of arriving at thetruth is in this case impossible. If, for example, we presuppose thatthe world of sense is given in itself in its totality, it is false,either that it is infinite, or that it is finite and limited in space.Both are false, because the hypothesis is false. For the notion ofphenomena (as mere representations) which are given in themselves (asobjects) is self-contradictory; and the infinitude of this imaginarywhole would, indeed, be unconditioned, but would be inconsistent (aseverything in the phenomenal world is conditioned) with theunconditioned determination and finitude of quantities which ispresupposed in our conception.The apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions whichhave always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmaticalphilosophy. It may be compared to a champion who maintains the honourand claims of the party he has adopted by offering battle to all whodoubt the validity of these claims and the purity of that honour; whilenothing can be proved in this way, except the respective strength ofthe combatants, and the advantage, in this respect, is always on theside of the attacking party. Spectators, observing that each party isalternately conqueror and conquered, are led to regard the subject ofdispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon. But such an opinioncannot be justified; and it is sufficient to apply to these reasonersthe remark:_Non defensoribus istisTempus eget._Each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deductionof the grounds of proof employed in his argument, and thus enable us tosee in what way the claims of reason may be supported. If an opponentbases his assertions upon subjective grounds, he may be refuted withease; not, however to the advantage of the dogmatist, who likewisedepends upon subjective sources of cognition and is in like mannerdriven into a corner by his opponent. But, if parties employ the directmethod of procedure, they will soon discover the difficulty, nay, theimpossibility of proving their assertions, and will be forced to appealto prescription and precedence; or they will, by the help of criticism,discover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had beenmocked, and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions tospeculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of itsproper sphere—that of practical principles.Chapter II. The Canon of Pure ReasonIt is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it isincompetent to discover truth by means of pure speculation, but, on thecontrary, stands in need of discipline to check its deviations from thestraight path and to expose the illusions which it originates. But, onthe other hand, this consideration ought to elevate and to give itconfidence, for this discipline is exercised by itself alone, and it issubject to the censure of no other power. The bounds, moreover, whichit is forced to set to its speculative exercise, form likewise a checkupon the fallacious pretensions of opponents; and thus what remains ofits possessions, after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed,is secure from attack or usurpation. The greatest, and perhaps theonly, use of all philosophy of pure reason is, accordingly, of a purelynegative character. It is not an organon for the extension, but adiscipline for the determination, of the limits of its exercise; andwithout laying claim to the discovery of new truth, it has the modestmerit of guarding against error.At the same time, there must be some source of positive cognitionswhich belong to the domain of pure reason and which become the causesof error only from our mistaking their true character, while they formthe goal towards which reason continually strives. How else can weaccount for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find afirm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world ofexperience? It hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge inwhich it has the deepest interest. It enters upon the path of purespeculation; but in vain. We have some reason, however, to expect that,in the only other way that lies open to it—the path of practicalreason—it may meet with better success.I understand by a canon a list of the à priori principles of the properemployment of certain faculties of cognition. Thus general logic, inits analytical department, is a formal canon for the faculties ofunderstanding and reason. In the same way, Transcendental Analytic wasseen to be a canon of the pure understanding; for it alone is competentto enounce true à priori synthetical cognitions. But, when no properemployment of a faculty of cognition is possible, no canon can exist.But the synthetical cognition of pure speculative reason is, as hasbeen shown, completely impossible. There cannot, therefore, exist anycanon for the speculative exercise of this faculty—for its speculativeexercise is entirely dialectical; and, consequently, transcendentallogic, in this respect, is merely a discipline, and not a canon. If,then, there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of purereason—in which case there must be a canon for this faculty—this canonwill relate, not to the speculative, but to the practical use ofreason. This canon we now proceed to investigate.Section I. Of the Ultimate End of the Pure Use of ReasonThere exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venturebeyond the field of experience, to attempt to reach the utmost boundsof all cognition by the help of ideas alone, and not to rest satisfieduntil it has fulfilled its course and raised the sum of its cognitionsinto a self-subsistent systematic whole. Is the motive for thisendeavour to be found in its speculative, or in its practical interestsalone?Setting aside, at present, the results of the labours of pure reason inits speculative exercise, I shall merely inquire regarding the problemsthe solution of which forms its ultimate aim, whether reached or not,and in relation to which all other aims are but partial andintermediate. These highest aims must, from the nature of reason,possess complete unity; otherwise the highest interest of humanitycould not be successfully promoted.The transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things: thefreedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence ofGod. The speculative interest which reason has in those questions isvery small; and, for its sake alone, we should not undertake the labourof transcendental investigation—a labour full of toil and ceaselessstruggle. We should be loth to undertake this labour, because thediscoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in thesphere of concrete or physical investigation. We may find out that thewill is free, but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible causeof our volition. As regards the phenomena or expressions of this will,that is, our actions, we are bound, in obedience to an inviolablemaxim, without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere ofexperience, to explain these in the same way as we explain all theother phenomena of nature, that is to say, according to itsunchangeable laws. We may have discovered the spirituality andimmortality of the soul, but we cannot employ this knowledge to explainthe phenomena of this life, nor the peculiar nature of the future,because our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative anddoes not add anything to our knowledge, and the only inferences to bedrawn from it are purely fictitious. If, again, we prove the existenceof a supreme intelligence, we should be able from it to make theconformity to aims existing in the arrangement of the worldcomprehensible; but we should not be justified in deducing from it anyparticular arrangement or disposition, or inferring any where it is notperceived. For it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of reasonthat we must not overlook natural causes, or refuse to listen to theteaching of experience, for the sake of deducing what we know andperceive from something that transcends all our knowledge. In one word,these three propositions are, for the speculative reason, alwaystranscendent, and cannot be employed as immanent principles in relationto the objects of experience; they are, consequently, of no use to usin this sphere, being but the valueless results of the severe butunprofitable efforts of reason.If, then, the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions isperfectly useless, while Reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce usto admit them, it is plain that their real value and importance relateto our practical, and not to our speculative interest.I term all that is possible through free will, practical. But if theconditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical, reason canhave only a regulative, and not a constitutive, influence upon it, andis serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empiricallaws. In the moral philosophy of prudence, for example, the solebusiness of reason is to bring about a union of all the ends, which areaimed at by our inclinations, into one ultimate end—that ofhappiness—and to show the agreement which should exist among the meansof attaining that end. In this sphere, accordingly, reason cannotpresent to us any other than pragmatical laws of free action, for ourguidance towards the aims set up by the senses, and is incompetent togive us laws which are pure and determined completely à priori. On theother hand, pure practical laws, the ends of which have been given byreason entirely à priori, and which are not empirically conditioned,but are, on the contrary, absolutely imperative in their nature, wouldbe products of pure reason. Such are the moral laws; and these alonebelong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason, and admit ofa canon.All the powers of reason, in the sphere of what may be termed purephilosophy, are, in fact, directed to the three above-mentionedproblems alone. These again have a still higher end—the answer to thequestion, what we ought to do, if the will is free, if there is a Godand a future world. Now, as this problem relates to our in reference tothe highest aim of humanity, it is evident that the ultimate intentionof nature, in the constitution of our reason, has been directed to themoral alone.We must take care, however, in turning our attention to an object whichis foreign[78] to the sphere of transcendental philosophy, not toinjure the unity of our system by digressions, nor, on the other hand,to fail in clearness, by saying too little on the new subject ofdiscussion. I hope to avoid both extremes, by keeping as close aspossible to the transcendental, and excluding all psychological, thatis, empirical, elements. [78] All practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain, and consequently—in an indirect manner, at least—to objects of feeling. But as feeling is not a faculty of representation, but lies out of the sphere of our powers of cognition, the elements of our judgements, in so far as they relate to pleasure or pain, that is, the elements of our practical judgements, do not belong to transcendental philosophy, which has to do with pure à priori cognitions alone.I have to remark, in the first place, that at present I treat of theconception of freedom in the practical sense only, and set aside thecorresponding transcendental conception, which cannot be employed as aground of explanation in the phenomenal world, but is itself a problemfor pure reason. A will is purely animal (arbitrium brutum) when it isdetermined by sensuous impulses or instincts only, that is, when it isdetermined in a pathological manner. A will, which can be determinedindependently of sensuous impulses, consequently by motives presentedby reason alone, is called a free will (arbitrium liberum); andeverything which is connected with this free will, either as principleor consequence, is termed practical. The existence of practical freedomcan be proved from experience alone. For the human will is notdetermined by that alone which immediately affects the senses; on thecontrary, we have the power, by calling up the notion of what is usefulor hurtful in a more distant relation, of overcoming the immediateimpressions on our sensuous faculty of desire. But these considerationsof what is desirable in relation to our whole state, that is, is in theend good and useful, are based entirely upon reason. This faculty,accordingly, enounces laws, which are imperative or objective laws offreedom and which tell us what ought to take place, thus distinguishingthemselves from the laws of nature, which relate to that which doestake place. The laws of freedom or of free will are hence termedpractical laws.Whether reason is not itself, in the actual delivery of these laws,determined in its turn by other influences, and whether the actionwhich, in relation to sensuous impulses, we call free, may not, inrelation to higher and more remote operative causes, really form a partof nature—these are questions which do not here concern us. They arepurely speculative questions; and all we have to do, in the practicalsphere, is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has topresent. Experience demonstrates to us the existence of practicalfreedom as one of the causes which exist in nature, that is, it showsthe causal power of reason in the determination of the will. The ideaof transcendental freedom, on the contrary, requires that reason—inrelation to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomena—shouldbe independent of all sensuous determining causes; and thus it seems tobe in opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience.It therefore remains a problem for the human mind. But this problemdoes not concern reason in its practical use; and we have, therefore,in a canon of pure reason, to do with only two questions, which relateto the practical interest of pure reason: Is there a God? and, Is therea future life? The question of transcendental freedom is purelyspeculative, and we may therefore set it entirely aside when we come totreat of practical reason. Besides, we have already discussed thissubject in the antinomy of pure reason.Section II. Of the Ideal of the Summum Bonum as a Determining Ground ofthe Ultimate End of Pure ReasonReason conducted us, in its speculative use, through the field ofexperience and, as it can never find complete satisfaction in thatsphere, from thence to speculative ideas—which, however, in the endbrought us back again to experience, and thus fulfilled the purpose ofreason, in a manner which, though useful, was not at all in accordancewith our expectations. It now remains for us to consider whether purereason can be employed in a practical sphere, and whether it will hereconduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason,as we have just stated them. We shall thus ascertain whether, from thepoint of view of its practical interest, reason may not be able tosupply us with that which, on the speculative side, it wholly deniesus.The whole interest of reason, speculative as well as practical, iscentred in the three following questions:1. WHAT CAN I KNOW?2. WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?3. WHAT MAY I HOPE?The first question is purely speculative. We have, as I flatter myself,exhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible, and have at lastfound the reply with which reason must content itself, and with whichit ought to be content, so long as it pays no regard to the practical.But from the two great ends to the attainment of which all theseefforts of pure reason were in fact directed, we remain just as farremoved as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at theoutset. So far, then, as knowledge is concerned, thus much, at least,is established, that, in regard to those two problems, it lies beyondour reach.The second question is purely practical. As such it may indeed fallwithin the province of pure reason, but still it is not transcendental,but moral, and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of ourcriticism.The third question: If I act as I ought to do, what may I then hope?—isat once practical and theoretical. The practical forms a clue to theanswer of the theoretical, and—in its highest form—speculativequestion. For all hoping has happiness for its object and stands inprecisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality asknowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature.The former arrives finally at the conclusion that something is (whichdetermines the ultimate end), because something ought to take place;the latter, that something is (which operates as the highest cause),because something does take place.Happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires; extensive, in regardto their multiplicity; intensive, in regard to their degree; andprotensive, in regard to their duration. The practical law based on themotive of happiness I term a pragmatical law (or prudential rule); butthat law, assuming such to exist, which has no other motive than theworthiness of being happy, I term a moral or ethical law. The firsttells us what we have to do, if we wish to become possessed ofhappiness; the second dictates how we ought to act, in order to deservehappiness. The first is based upon empirical principles; for it is onlyby experience that I can learn either what inclinations exist whichdesire satisfaction, or what are the natural means of satisfying them.The second takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfyingthem, and regards only the freedom of a rational being, and thenecessary conditions under which alone this freedom can harmonize withthe distribution of happiness according to principles. This second lawmay therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure reason, and may be cognizedà priori.I assume that there are pure moral laws which determine, entirely àpriori (without regard to empirical motives, that is, to happiness),the conduct of a rational being, or in other words, to use which itmakes of its freedom, and that these laws are absolutely imperative(not merely hypothetically, on the supposition of other empiricalends), and therefore in all respects necessary. I am warranted inassuming this, not only by the arguments of the most enlightenedmoralists, but by the moral judgement of every man who will make theattempt to form a distinct conception of such a law.Pure reason, then, contains, not indeed in its speculative, but in itspractical, or, more strictly, its moral use, principles of thepossibility of experience, of such actions, namely, as, in accordancewith ethical precepts, might be met with in the history of man. Forsince reason commands that such actions should take place, it must bepossible for them to take place; and hence a particular kind ofsystematic unity—the moral—must be possible. We have found, it is true,that the systematic unity of nature could not be established accordingto speculative principles of reason, because, while reason possesses acausal power in relation to freedom, it has none in relation to thewhole sphere of nature; and, while moral principles of reason canproduce free actions, they cannot produce natural laws. It is, then, inits practical, but especially in its moral use, that the principles ofpure reason possess objective reality.I call the world a moral world, in so far as it may be in accordancewith all the ethical laws—which, by virtue of the freedom of reasonablebeings, it can be, and according to the necessary laws of morality itought to be. But this world must be conceived only as an intelligibleworld, inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions(ends), and even of all impediments to morality (the weakness orpravity of human nature). So far, then, it is a mere idea—though stilla practical idea—which may have, and ought to have, an influence on theworld of sense, so as to bring it as far as possible into conformitywith itself. The idea of a moral world has, therefore, objectivereality, not as referring to an object of intelligible intuition—for ofsuch an object we can form no conception whatever—but to the world ofsense—conceived, however, as an object of pure reason in its practicaluse—and to a corpus mysticum of rational beings in it, in so far as theliberum arbitrium of the individual is placed, under and by virtue ofmoral laws, in complete systematic unity both with itself and with thefreedom of all others.That is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reasonwhich relate to its practical interest: Do that which will render theeworthy of happiness. The second question is this: If I conduct myselfso as not to be unworthy of happiness, may I hope thereby to obtainhappiness? In order to arrive at the solution of this question, we mustinquire whether the principles of pure reason, which prescribe à priorithe law, necessarily also connect this hope with it.I say, then, that just as the moral principles are necessary accordingto reason in its practical use, so it is equally necessary according toreason in its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground tohope for happiness in the measure in which he has made himself worthyof it in his conduct, and that therefore the system of morality isinseparably (though only in the idea of pure reason) connected withthat of happiness.Now in an intelligible, that is, in the moral world, in the conceptionof which we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality(sensuous desires), such a system of happiness, connected with andproportioned to morality, may be conceived as necessary, becausefreedom of volition—partly incited, and partly restrained by morallaws—would be itself the cause of general happiness; and thus rationalbeings, under the guidance of such principles, would be themselves theauthors both of their own enduring welfare and that of others. But sucha system of self-rewarding morality is only an idea, the carrying outof which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he ought; inother words, that all actions of reasonable beings be such as theywould be if they sprung from a Supreme Will, comprehending in, orunder, itself all particular wills. But since the moral law is bindingon each individual in the use of his freedom of volition, even ifothers should not act in conformity with this law, neither the natureof things, nor the causality of actions and their relation to morality,determine how the consequences of these actions will be related tohappiness; and the necessary connection of the hope of happiness withthe unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness, cannot becognized by reason, if we take nature alone for our guide. Thisconnection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause ofnature is a supreme reason, which governs according to moral laws.I term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfectwill, united with supreme blessedness, is the cause of all happiness inthe world, so far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality(as the worthiness of being happy), the ideal of the supreme Good. Itis only, then, in the ideal of the supreme original good, that purereason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection ofboth elements of the highest derivative good, and accordingly of anintelligible, that is, moral world. Now since we are necessitated byreason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world, while thesenses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena, we must assumethe former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense (sincethe world of sense gives us no hint of it), and therefore as future inrelation to us. Thus God and a future life are two hypotheses which,according to the principles of pure reason, are inseparable from theobligation which this reason imposes upon us.Morality per se constitutes a system. But we can form no system ofhappiness, except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion tomorality. But this is only possible in the intelligible world, under awise author and ruler. Such a ruler, together with life in such aworld, which we must look upon as future, reason finds itself compelledto assume; or it must regard the moral laws as idle dreams, since thenecessary consequence which this same reason connects with them must,without this hypothesis, fall to the ground. Hence also the moral lawsare universally regarded as commands, which they could not be did theynot connect à priori adequate consequences with their dictates, andthus carry with them promises and threats. But this, again, they couldnot do, did they not reside in a necessary being, as the Supreme Good,which alone can render such a teleological unity possible.Leibnitz termed the world, when viewed in relation to the rationalbeings which it contains, and the moral relations in which they standto each other, under the government of the Supreme Good, the kingdom ofGrace, and distinguished it from the kingdom of Nature, in which theserational beings live, under moral laws, indeed, but expect no otherconsequences from their actions than such as follow according to thecourse of nature in the world of sense. To view ourselves, therefore,as in the kingdom of grace, in which all happiness awaits us, except inso far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions whichrender us unworthy of happiness, is a practically necessary idea ofreason.Practical laws, in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions,that is, subjective principles, are termed maxims. The judgements ofmoral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framedaccording ideas; the observance of its laws, according to maxims.The whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims; but thisis impossible, unless with the moral law, which is a mere idea, reasonconnects an efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is inconformity with the moral law an issue either in this or in anotherlife, which is in exact conformity with our highest aims. Thus, withouta God and without a world, invisible to us now, but hoped for, theglorious ideas of morality are, indeed, objects of approbation and ofadmiration, but cannot be the springs of purpose and action. For theydo not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being,and which are determined à priori by pure reason itself, and necessary.Happiness alone is, in the view of reason, far from being the completegood. Reason does not approve of it (however much inclination maydesire it), except as united with desert. On the other hand, moralityalone, and with it, mere desert, is likewise far from being thecomplete good. To make it complete, he who conducts himself in a mannernot unworthy of happiness, must be able to hope for the possession ofhappiness. Even reason, unbiased by private ends, or interestedconsiderations, cannot judge otherwise, if it puts itself in the placeof a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others.For in the practical idea both points are essentially combined, thoughin such a way that participation in happiness is rendered possible bythe moral disposition, as its condition, and not conversely, the moraldisposition by the prospect of happiness. For a disposition whichshould require the prospect of happiness as its necessary conditionwould not be moral, and hence also would not be worthy of completehappiness—a happiness which, in the view of reason, recognizes nolimitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct.Happiness, therefore, in exact proportion with the morality of rationalbeings (whereby they are made worthy of happiness), constitutes alonethe supreme good of a world into which we absolutely must transportourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason. Thisworld is, it is true, only an intelligible world; for of such asystematic unity of ends as it requires, the world of sense gives us nohint. Its reality can be based on nothing else but the hypothesis of asupreme original good. In it independent reason, equipped with all thesufficiency of a supreme cause, founds, maintains, and fulfils theuniversal order of things, with the most perfect teleological harmony,however much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense.This moral theology has the peculiar advantage, in contrast withspeculative theology, of leading inevitably to the conception of asole, perfect, and rational First Cause, whereof speculative theologydoes not give us any indication on objective grounds, far less anyconvincing evidence. For we find neither in transcendental nor innatural theology, however far reason may lead us in these, any groundto warrant us in assuming the existence of one only Being, which standsat the head of all natural causes, and on which these are entirelydependent. On the other hand, if we take our stand on moral unity as anecessary law of the universe, and from this point of view considerwhat is necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and, for us,obligatory force, we must come to the conclusion that there is one onlysupreme will, which comprehends all these laws in itself. For how,under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends? This willmust be omnipotent, that all nature and its relation to morality in theworld may be subject to it; omniscient, that it may have knowledge ofthe most secret feelings and their moral worth; omnipresent, that itmay be at hand to supply every necessity to which the highest weal ofthe world may give rise; eternal, that this harmony of nature andliberty may never fail; and so on.But this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligences—which,as mere nature, is only a world of sense, but, as a system of freedomof volition, may be termed an intelligible, that is, moral world(regnum gratiae)—leads inevitably also to the teleological unity of allthings which constitute this great whole, according to universalnatural laws—just as the unity of the former is according to universaland necessary moral laws—and unites the practical with the speculativereason. The world must be represented as having originated from anidea, if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which wecannot even consider ourselves as worthy of reason—namely, the moraluse, which rests entirely on the idea of the supreme good. Hence theinvestigation of nature receives a teleological direction, and becomes,in its widest extension, physico-theology. But this, taking its rise inmoral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom, and notaccidentally instituted by external commands, establishes theteleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparablyconnected with the internal possibility of things. This gives rise to atranscendental theology, which takes the ideal of the highestontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity; and thisprinciple connects all things according to universal and necessarynatural laws, because all things have their origin in the absolutenecessity of the one only Primal Being.What use can we make of our understanding, even in respect ofexperience, if we do not propose ends to ourselves? But the highestends are those of morality, and it is only pure reason that can give usthe knowledge of these. Though supplied with these, and puttingourselves under their guidance, we can make no teleological use of theknowledge of nature, as regards cognition, unless nature itself hasestablished teleological unity. For without this unity we should noteven possess reason, because we should have no school for reason, andno cultivation through objects which afford the materials for itsconceptions. But teleological unity is a necessary unity, and foundedon the essence of the individual will itself. Hence this will, which isthe condition of the application of this unity in concreto, must be solikewise. In this way the transcendental enlargement of our rationalcognition would be, not the cause, but merely the effect of thepractical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us.Hence, also, we find in the history of human reason that, before themoral conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined, and beforemen had attained to a perception of the systematic unity of endsaccording to these conceptions and from necessary principles, theknowledge of nature, and even a considerable amount of intellectualculture in many other sciences, could produce only rude and vagueconceptions of the Deity, sometimes even admitting of an astonishingindifference with regard to this question altogether. But the moreenlarged treatment of moral ideas, which was rendered necessary by theextreme pure moral law of our religion, awakened the interest, andthereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object.In this way, and without the help either of an extended acquaintancewith nature, or of a reliable transcendental insight (for these havebeen wanting in all ages), a conception of the Divine Being was arrivedat, which we now hold to be the correct one, not because speculativereason convinces us of its correctness, but because it accords with themoral principles of reason. Thus it is to pure reason, but only in itspractical use, that we must ascribe the merit of having connected withour highest interest a cognition, of which mere speculation was ableonly to form a conjecture, but the validity of which it was unable toestablish—and of having thereby rendered it, not indeed a demonstrateddogma, but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends ofreason.But if practical reason has reached this elevation, and has attained tothe conception of a sole Primal Being as the supreme good, it must not,therefore, imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions ofits application, and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects;it must not presume to start from the conception which it has gained,and to deduce from it the moral laws themselves. For it was these verylaws, the internal practical necessity of which led us to thehypothesis of an independent cause, or of a wise ruler of the universe,who should give them effect. Hence we are not entitled to regard themas accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler, especiallyas we have no conception of such a will, except as formed in accordancewith these laws. So far, then, as practical reason has the right toconduct us, we shall not look upon actions as binding on us, becausethey are the commands of God, but we shall regard them as divinecommands, because we are internally bound by them. We shall studyfreedom under the teleological unity which accords with principles ofreason; we shall look upon ourselves as acting in conformity with thedivine will only in so far as we hold sacred the moral law which reasonteaches us from the nature of actions themselves, and we shall believethat we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the universein ourselves and in others. Moral theology is, therefore, only ofimmanent use. It teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world, byplacing ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends, and warnsus against the fanaticism, nay, the crime of depriving reason of itslegislative authority in the moral conduct of life, for the purpose ofdirectly connecting this authority with the idea of the Supreme Being.For this would be, not an immanent, but a transcendent use of moraltheology, and, like the transcendent use of mere speculation, wouldinevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.Section III. Of Opinion, Knowledge, and BeliefThe holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understandingwhich may rest on objective grounds, but requires, also, subjectivecauses in the mind of the person judging. If a judgement is valid forevery rational being, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and itis termed a conviction. If, on the other hand, it has its ground in theparticular character of the subject, it is termed a persuasion.Persuasion is a mere illusion, the ground of the judgement, which liessolely in the subject, being regarded as objective. Hence a judgementof this kind has only private validity—is only valid for the individualwho judges, and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot becommunicated. But truth depends upon agreement with the object, andconsequently the judgements of all understandings, if true, must be inagreement with each other (consentientia uni tertio consentiunt interse). Conviction may, therefore, be distinguished, from an externalpoint of view, from persuasion, by the possibility of communicating itand by showing its validity for the reason of every man; for in thiscase the presumption, at least, arises that the agreement of alljudgements with each other, in spite of the different characters ofindividuals, rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each withthe object, and thus the correctness of the judgement is established.Persuasion, accordingly, cannot be subjectively distinguished fromconviction, that is, so long as the subject views its judgement simplyas a phenomenon of its own mind. But if we inquire whether the groundsof our judgement, which are valid for us, produce the same effect onthe reason of others as on our own, we have then the means, though onlysubjective means, not, indeed, of producing conviction, but ofdetecting the merely private validity of the judgement; in other words,of discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion.If we can, in addition to this, develop the subjective causes of thejudgement, which we have taken for its objective grounds, and thusexplain the deceptive judgement as a phenomenon in our mind, apartaltogether from the objective character of the object, we can thenexpose the illusion and need be no longer deceived by it, although, ifits subjective cause lies in our nature, we cannot hope altogether toescape its influence.I can only maintain, that is, affirm as necessarily valid for everyone, that which produces conviction. Persuasion I may keep for myself,if it is agreeable to me; but I cannot, and ought not, to attempt toimpose it as binding upon others.Holding for true, or the subjective validity of a judgement in relationto conviction (which is, at the same time, objectively valid), has thethree following degrees: opinion, belief, and knowledge. Opinion is aconsciously insufficient judgement, subjectively as well asobjectively. Belief is subjectively sufficient, but is recognized asbeing objectively insufficient. Knowledge is both subjectively andobjectively sufficient. Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction(for myself); objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all). Ineed not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple conceptions.I must never venture to be of opinion, without knowing something, atleast, by which my judgement, in itself merely problematical, isbrought into connection with the truth—which connection, although notperfect, is still something more than an arbitrary fiction. Moreover,the law of such a connection must be certain. For if, in relation tothis law, I have nothing more than opinion, my judgement is but a playof the imagination, without the least relation to truth. In thejudgements of pure reason, opinion has no place. For, as they do notrest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that ofnecessary truth and à priori cognition, the principle of connection init requires universality and necessity, and consequently perfectcertainty—otherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all. Henceit is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics; we must know, orabstain from forming a judgement altogether. The case is the same withthe maxims of morality. For we must not hazard an action on the mereopinion that it is allowed, but we must know it to be so. In thetranscendental sphere of reason, on the other hand, the term opinion istoo weak, while the word knowledge is too strong. From the merelyspeculative point of view, therefore, we cannot form a judgement atall. For the subjective grounds of a judgement, such as produce belief,cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries, inasmuch as they cannotstand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicatedto others in equal measure.But it is only from the practical point of view that a theoreticallyinsufficient judgement can be termed belief. Now the practicalreference is either to skill or to morality; to the former, when theend proposed is arbitrary and accidental, to the latter, when it isabsolutely necessary.If we propose to ourselves any end whatever, the conditions of itsattainment are hypothetically necessary. The necessity is subjectively,but still only comparatively, sufficient, if I am acquainted with noother conditions under which the end can be attained. On the otherhand, it is sufficient, absolutely and for every one, if I know forcertain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions underwhich the attainment of the proposed end would be possible. In theformer case my supposition—my judgement with regard to certainconditions—is a merely accidental belief; in the latter it is anecessary belief. The physician must pursue some course in the case ofa patient who is in danger, but is ignorant of the nature of thedisease. He observes the symptoms, and concludes, according to the bestof his judgement, that it is a case of phthisis. His belief is, even inhis own judgement, only contingent: another man might, perhaps comenearer the truth. Such a belief, contingent indeed, but still formingthe ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certainends, I term Pragmatical belief.The usual test, whether that which any one maintains is merely hispersuasion, or his subjective conviction at least, that is, his firmbelief, is a bet. It frequently happens that a man delivers hisopinions with so much boldness and assurance, that he appears to beunder no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error. Theoffer of a bet startles him, and makes him pause. Sometimes it turnsout that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat, but not at ten. Forhe does not hesitate, perhaps, to venture a ducat, but if it isproposed to stake ten, he immediately becomes aware of the possibilityof his being mistaken—a possibility which has hitherto escaped hisobservation. If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake thehappiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, ourjudgement drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover theactual strength of our belief. Thus pragmatical belief has degrees,varying in proportion to the interests at stake.Now, in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action inreference to some object, and where, accordingly, our judgement ispurely theoretical, we can still represent to ourselves, in thought,the possibility of a course of action, for which we suppose that wehave sufficient grounds, if any means existed of ascertaining the truthof the matter. Thus we find in purely theoretical judgements ananalogon of practical judgements, to which the word belief may properlybe applied, and which we may term doctrinal belief. I should nothesitate to stake my all on the truth of the proposition—if there wereany possibility of bringing it to the test of experience—that, atleast, some one of the planets, which we see, is inhabited. Hence I saythat I have not merely the opinion, but the strong belief, on thecorrectness of which I would stake even many of the advantages of life,that there are inhabitants in other worlds.Now we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of God belongs todoctrinal belief. For, although in respect to the theoretical cognitionof the universe I do not require to form any theory which necessarilyinvolves this idea, as the condition of my explanation of the phenomenawhich the universe presents, but, on the contrary, am rather bound soto use my reason as if everything were mere nature, still teleologicalunity is so important a condition of the application of my reason tonature, that it is impossible for me to ignore it—especially since, inaddition to these considerations, abundant examples of it are suppliedby experience. But the sole condition, so far as my knowledge extends,under which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature,is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all thingsaccording to the wisest ends. Consequently, the hypothesis of a wiseauthor of the universe is necessary for my guidance in theinvestigation of nature—is the condition under which alone I can fulfilan end which is contingent indeed, but by no means unimportant.Moreover, since the result of my attempts so frequently confirms theutility of this assumption, and since nothing decisive can be adducedagainst it, it follows that it would be saying far too little to termmy judgement, in this case, a mere opinion, and that, even in thistheoretical connection, I may assert that I firmly believe in God.Still, if we use words strictly, this must not be called a practical,but a doctrinal belief, which the theology of nature (physico-theology)must also produce in my mind. In the wisdom of a Supreme Being, and inthe shortness of life, so inadequate to the development of the gloriouspowers of human nature, we may find equally sufficient grounds for adoctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul.The expression of belief is, in such cases, an expression of modestyfrom the objective point of view, but, at the same time, of firmconfidence, from the subjective. If I should venture to term thismerely theoretical judgement even so much as a hypothesis which I amentitled to assume; a more complete conception, with regard to anotherworld and to the cause of the world, might then be justly required ofme than I am, in reality, able to give. For, if I assume anything, evenas a mere hypothesis, I must, at least, know so much of the propertiesof such a being as will enable me, not to form the conception, but toimagine the existence of it. But the word belief refers only to theguidance which an idea gives me, and to its subjective influence on theconduct of my reason, which forces me to hold it fast, though I may notbe in a position to give a speculative account of it.But mere doctrinal belief is, to some extent, wanting in stability. Weoften quit our hold of it, in consequence of the difficulties whichoccur in speculation, though in the end we inevitably return to itagain.It is quite otherwise with moral belief. For in this sphere action isabsolutely necessary, that is, I must act in obedience to the moral lawin all points. The end is here incontrovertibly established, and thereis only one condition possible, according to the best of my perception,under which this end can harmonize with all other ends, and so havepractical validity—namely, the existence of a God and of a futureworld. I know also, to a certainty, that no one can be acquainted withany other conditions which conduct to the same unity of ends under themoral law. But since the moral precept is, at the same time, my maxim(as reason requires that it should be), I am irresistibly constrainedto believe in the existence of God and in a future life; and I am surethat nothing can make me waver in this belief, since I should therebyoverthrow my moral maxims, the renunciation of which would render mehateful in my own eyes.Thus, while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyondthe limits of experience end in disappointment, there is still enoughleft to satisfy us in a practical point of view. No one, it is true,will be able to boast that he knows that there is a God and a futurelife; for, if he knows this, he is just the man whom I have long wishedto find. All knowledge, regarding an object of mere reason, can becommunicated; and I should thus be enabled to hope that my ownknowledge would receive this wonderful extension, through theinstrumentality of his instruction. No, my conviction is not logical,but moral certainty; and since it rests on subjective grounds (of themoral sentiment), I must not even say: It is morally certain that thereis a God, etc., but: I am morally certain, that is, my belief in Godand in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that I amunder as little apprehension of having the former torn from me as oflosing the latter.The only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion isthat this rational belief presupposes the existence of moralsentiments. If we give up this assumption, and take a man who isentirely indifferent with regard to moral laws, the question whichreason proposes, becomes then merely a problem for speculation and may,indeed, be supported by strong grounds from analogy, but not by such aswill compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way.[79] But in thesequestions no man is free from all interest. For though the want of goodsentiments may place him beyond the influence of moral interests, stilleven in this case enough may be left to make him fear the existence ofGod and a future life. For he cannot pretend to any certainty of thenon-existence of God and of a future life, unless—since it could onlybe proved by mere reason, and therefore apodeictically—he is preparedto establish the impossibility of both, which certainly no reasonableman would undertake to do. This would be a negative belief, which couldnot, indeed, produce morality and good sentiments, but still couldproduce an analogon of these, by operating as a powerful restraint onthe outbreak of evil dispositions. [79] The human mind (as, I believe, every rational being must of necessity do) takes a natural interest in morality, although this interest is not undivided, and may not be practically in preponderance. If you strengthen and increase it, you will find the reason become docile, more enlightened, and more capable of uniting the speculative interest with the practical. But if you do not take care at the outset, or at least midway, to make men good, you will never force them into an honest belief.But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, inopening up prospects beyond the limits of experience? Nothing more thantwo articles of belief? Common sense could have done as much as this,without taking the philosophers to counsel in the matter!I shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which thelaborious efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reason—evengranting that its merit should turn out in the end to be onlynegative—for on this point something more will be said in the nextsection. But, I ask, do you require that that knowledge which concernsall men, should transcend the common understanding, and should only berevealed to you by philosophers? The very circumstance which has calledforth your censure, is the best confirmation of the correctness of ourprevious assertions, since it discloses, what could not have beenforeseen, that Nature is not chargeable with any partial distributionof her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinctionand that, in respect to the essential ends of human nature, we cannotadvance further with the help of the highest philosophy, than under theguidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding.Chapter III. The Architectonic of Pure ReasonBy the term architectonic I mean the art of constructing a system.Without systematic unity, our knowledge cannot become science; it willbe an aggregate, and not a system. Thus architectonic is the doctrineof the scientific in cognition, and therefore necessarily forms part ofour methodology.Reason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected andrhapsodistic state, but requires that the sum of our cognitions shouldconstitute a system. It is thus alone that they can advance the ends ofreason. By a system I mean the unity of various cognitions under oneidea. This idea is the conception—given by reason—of the form of awhole, in so far as the conception determines à priori not only thelimits of its content, but the place which each of its parts is tooccupy. The scientific idea contains, therefore, the end and the formof the whole which is in accordance with that end. The unity of theend, to which all the parts of the system relate, and through which allhave a relation to each other, communicates unity to the whole system,so that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from ourknowledge of the rest; and it determines à priori the limits of thesystem, thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions. The wholeis thus an organism (articulatio), and not an aggregate (coacervatio);it may grow from within (per intussusceptionem), but it cannot increaseby external additions (per appositionem). It is, thus, like an animalbody, the growth of which does not add any limb, but, without changingtheir proportions, makes each in its sphere stronger and more active.We require, for the execution of the idea of a system, a schema, thatis, a content and an arrangement of parts determined à priori by theprinciple which the aim of the system prescribes. A schema which is notprojected in accordance with an idea, that is, from the standpoint ofthe highest aim of reason, but merely empirically, in accordance withaccidental aims and purposes (the number of which cannot bepredetermined), can give us nothing more than technical unity. But theschema which is originated from an idea (in which case reason presentsus with aims à priori, and does not look for them to experience), formsthe basis of architectonical unity. A science, in the properacceptation of that term, cannot be formed technically, that is, fromobservation of the similarity existing between different objects, andthe purely contingent use we make of our knowledge in concreto withreference to all kinds of arbitrary external aims; its constitutionmust be framed on architectonical principles, that is, its parts mustbe shown to possess an essential affinity, and be capable of beingdeduced from one supreme and internal aim or end, which forms thecondition of the possibility of the scientific whole. The schema of ascience must give à priori the plan of it (monogramma), and thedivision of the whole into parts, in conformity with the idea of thescience; and it must also distinguish this whole from all others,according to certain understood principles.No one will attempt to construct a science, unless he have some idea torest on as a proper basis. But, in the elaboration of the science, hefinds that the schema, nay, even the definition which he at first gaveof the science, rarely corresponds with his idea; for this idea lies,like a germ, in our reason, its parts undeveloped and hid even frommicroscopical observation. For this reason, we ought to explain anddefine sciences, not according to the description which the originatorgives of them, but according to the idea which we find based in reasonitself, and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of thescience already accumulated. For it will of ten be found that theoriginator of a science and even his latest successors remain attachedto an erroneous idea, which they cannot render clear to themselves, andthat they thus fail in determining the true content, the articulationor systematic unity, and the limits of their science.It is unfortunate that, only after having occupied ourselves for a longtime in the collection of materials, under the guidance of an ideawhich lies undeveloped in the mind, but not according to any definiteplan of arrangement—nay, only after we have spent much time and labourin the technical disposition of our materials, does it become possibleto view the idea of a science in a clear light, and to project,according to architectonical principles, a plan of the whole, inaccordance with the aims of reason. Systems seem, like certain worms,to be formed by a kind of generatio aequivoca—by the mere confluence ofconceptions, and to gain completeness only with the progress of time.But the schema or germ of all lies in reason; and thus is not onlyevery system organized according to its own idea, but all are unitedinto one grand system of human knowledge, of which they form members.For this reason, it is possible to frame an architectonic of all humancognition, the formation of which, at the present time, considering theimmense materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems,would not indeed be very difficult. Our purpose at present is merely tosketch the plan of the architectonic of all cognition given by purereason; and we begin from the point where the main root of humanknowledge divides into two, one of which is reason. By reason Iunderstand here the whole higher faculty of cognition, the rationalbeing placed in contradistinction to the empirical.If I make complete abstraction of the content of cognition, objectivelyconsidered, all cognition is, from a subjective point of view, eitherhistorical or rational. Historical cognition is cognitio ex datis,rational, cognitio ex principiis. Whatever may be the original sourceof a cognition, it is, in relation to the person who possesses it,merely historical, if he knows only what has been given him fromanother quarter, whether that knowledge was communicated by directexperience or by instruction. Thus the Person who has learned a systemof philosophy—say the Wolfian—although he has a perfect knowledge ofall the principles, definitions, and arguments in that philosophy, aswell as of the divisions that have been made of the system, possessesreally no more than an historical knowledge of the Wolfian system; heknows only what has been told him, his judgements are only those whichhe has received from his teachers. Dispute the validity of adefinition, and he is completely at a loss to find another. He hasformed his mind on another’s; but the imitative faculty is not theproductive. His knowledge has not been drawn from reason; and although,objectively considered, it is rational knowledge, subjectively, it ismerely historical. He has learned this or that philosophy and is merelya plaster cast of a living man. Rational cognitions which areobjective, that is, which have their source in reason, can be so termedfrom a subjective point of view, only when they have been drawn by theindividual himself from the sources of reason, that is, fromprinciples; and it is in this way alone that criticism, or even therejection of what has been already learned, can spring up in the mind.All rational cognition is, again, based either on conceptions, or onthe construction of conceptions. The former is termed philosophical,the latter mathematical. I have already shown the essential differenceof these two methods of cognition in the first chapter. A cognition maybe objectively philosophical and subjectively historical—as is the casewith the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond thelimits of their system, and who remain in a state of pupilage all theirlives. But it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge, when committedto memory, is valid, from the subjective point of view, as rationalknowledge also, and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here asin the case of philosophical cognition. The reason is that the only wayof arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles ofreason, and thus it is always certain and indisputable; because reasonis employed in concreto—but at the same time à priori—that is, in pureand, therefore, infallible intuition; and thus all causes of illusionand error are excluded. Of all the à priori sciences of reason,therefore, mathematics alone can be learned. Philosophy—unless it be inan historical manner—cannot be learned; we can at most learn tophilosophize.Philosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition. We must usethis term in an objective sense, if we understand by it the archetypeof all attempts at philosophizing, and the standard by which allsubjective philosophies are to be judged. In this sense, philosophy ismerely the idea of a possible science, which does not exist inconcreto, but to which we endeavour in various ways to approximate,until we have discovered the right path to pursue—a path overgrown bythe errors and illusions of sense—and the image we have hitherto triedin vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great prototype.Until that time, we cannot learn philosophy—it does not exist; if itdoes, where is it, who possesses it, and how shall we know it? We canonly learn to philosophize; in other words, we can only exercise ourpowers of reasoning in accordance with general principles, retaining atthe same time, the right of investigating the sources of theseprinciples, of testing, and even of rejecting them.Until then, our conception of philosophy is only a scholasticconception—a conception, that is, of a system of cognition which we aretrying to elaborate into a science; all that we at present know beingthe systematic unity of this cognition, and consequently the logicalcompleteness of the cognition for the desired end. But there is also acosmical conception (conceptus cosmicus) of philosophy, which hasalways formed the true basis of this term, especially when philosophywas personified and presented to us in the ideal of a philosopher. Inthis view philosophy is the science of the relation of all cognition tothe ultimate and essential aims of human reason (teleologia rationishumanae), and the philosopher is not merely an artist—who occupieshimself with conceptions—but a lawgiver, legislating for human reason.In this sense of the word, it would be in the highest degree arrogantto assume the title of philosopher, and to pretend that we had reachedthe perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone.The mathematician, the natural philosopher, and the logician—how farsoever the first may have advanced in rational, and the two latter inphilosophical knowledge—are merely artists, engaged in the arrangementand formation of conceptions; they cannot be termed philosophers. Abovethem all, there is the ideal teacher, who employs them as instrumentsfor the advancement of the essential aims of human reason. Him alonecan we call philosopher; but he nowhere exists. But the idea of hislegislative power resides in the mind of every man, and it aloneteaches us what kind of systematic unity philosophy demands in view ofthe ultimate aims of reason. This idea is, therefore, a cosmicalconception.[80] [80] By a cosmical conception, I mean one in which all men necessarily take an interest; the aim of a science must accordingly be determined according to scholastic conceptions, if it is regarded merely as a means to certain arbitrarily proposed ends.In view of the complete systematic unity of reason, there can only beone ultimate end of all the operations of the mind. To this all otheraims are subordinate, and nothing more than means for its attainment.This ultimate end is the destination of man, and the philosophy whichrelates to it is termed moral philosophy. The superior positionoccupied by moral philosophy, above all other spheres for theoperations of reason, sufficiently indicates the reason why theancients always included the idea—and in an especial manner—of moralistin that of philosopher. Even at the present day, we call a man whoappears to have the power of self-government, even although hisknowledge may be very limited, by the name of philosopher.The legislation of human reason, or philosophy, has two objects—natureand freedom—and thus contains not only the laws of nature, but alsothose of ethics, at first in two separate systems, which, finally,merge into one grand philosophical system of cognition. The philosophyof nature relates to that which is, that of ethics to that which oughtto be.But all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason, orthe cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles. Theformer is termed pure, the latter empirical philosophy.The philosophy of pure reason is either propædeutic, that is, aninquiry into the powers of reason in regard to pure à priori cognition,and is termed critical philosophy; or it is, secondly, the system ofpure reason—a science containing the systematic presentation of thewhole body of philosophical knowledge, true as well as illusory, givenby pure reason—and is called metaphysic. This name may, however, bealso given to the whole system of pure philosophy, critical philosophyincluded, and may designate the investigation into the sources orpossibility of à priori cognition, as well as the presentation of the àpriori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophy—excluding, atthe same time, all empirical and mathematical elements.Metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of thepractical use of pure reason, and is, accordingly, either themetaphysic of nature, or the metaphysic of ethics. The former containsall the pure rational principles—based upon conceptions alone (and thusexcluding mathematics)—of all theoretical cognition; the latter, theprinciples which determine and necessitate à priori all action. Nowmoral philosophy alone contains a code of laws—for the regulation ofour actions—which are deduced from principles entirely à priori. Hencethe metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy, as it isnot based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations. Themetaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysicin the more limited sense. But as pure moral philosophy properly formsa part of this system of cognition, we must allow it to retain the nameof metaphysic, although it is not requisite that we should insist on soterming it in our present discussion.It is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions whichdiffer from others both in kind and in origin, and to take great carethat they are not confounded with those with which they are generallyfound connected. What the chemist does in the analysis of substances,what the mathematician in pure mathematics, is, in a still higherdegree, the duty of the philosopher, that the value of each differentkind of cognition, and the part it takes in the operations of the mind,may be clearly defined. Human reason has never wanted a metaphysic ofsome kind, since it attained the power of thought, or rather ofreflection; but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thoughtand cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements. The idea ofa science of this kind is as old as speculation itself; and what minddoes not speculate—either in the scholastic or in the popular fashion?At the same time, it must be admitted that even thinkers by professionhave been unable clearly to explain the distinction between the twoelements of our cognition—the one completely à priori, the other àposteriori; and hence the proper definition of a peculiar kind ofcognition, and with it the just idea of a science which has so long andso deeply engaged the attention of the human mind, has never beenestablished. When it was said: “Metaphysic is the science of the firstprinciples of human cognition,” this definition did not signalize apeculiarity in kind, but only a difference in degree; these firstprinciples were thus declared to be more general than others, but nocriterion of distinction from empirical principles was given. Of thesesome are more general, and therefore higher, than others; and—as wecannot distinguish what is completely à priori from that which is knownto be à posteriori—where shall we draw the line which is to separatethe higher and so-called first principles, from the lower andsubordinate principles of cognition? What would be said if we wereasked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world intothe earlier centuries and those following them? “Does the fifth, or thetenth century belong to the earlier centuries?” it would be asked. Inthe same way I ask: Does the conception of extension belong tometaphysics? You answer, “Yes.” Well, that of body too? “Yes.” And thatof a fluid body? You stop, you are unprepared to admit this; for if youdo, everything will belong to metaphysics. From this it is evident thatthe mere degree of subordination—of the particular to thegeneral—cannot determine the limits of a science; and that, in thepresent case, we must expect to find a difference in the conceptions ofmetaphysics both in kind and in origin. The fundamental idea ofmetaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind ofà priori cognition showed a certain similarity in character with thescience of mathematics. Both have the property in common of possessingan à priori origin; but, in the one, our knowledge is based uponconceptions, in the other, on the construction of conceptions. Thus adecided dissimilarity between philosophical and mathematical cognitioncomes out—a dissimilarity which was always felt, but which could not bemade distinct for want of an insight into the criteria of thedifference. And thus it happened that, as philosophers themselvesfailed in the proper development of the idea of their science, theelaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim, orunder trustworthy guidance. Thus, too, philosophers, ignorant of thepath they ought to pursue and always disputing with each otherregarding the discoveries which each asserted he had made, broughttheir science into disrepute with the rest of the world, and finally,even among themselves.All pure à priori cognition forms, therefore, in view of the peculiarfaculty which originates it, a peculiar and distinct unity; andmetaphysic is the term applied to the philosophy which attempts torepresent that cognition in this systematic unity. The speculative partof metaphysic, which has especially appropriated this appellation—thatwhich we have called the metaphysic of nature—and which considerseverything, as it is (not as it ought to be), by means of à prioriconceptions, is divided in the following manner.Metaphysic, in the more limited acceptation of the term, consists oftwo parts—transcendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason.The former presents the system of all the conceptions and principlesbelonging to the understanding and the reason, and which relate toobjects in general, but not to any particular given objects(Ontologia); the latter has nature for its subject-matter, that is, thesum of given objects—whether given to the senses, or, if we will, tosome other kind of intuition—and is accordingly physiology, althoughonly rationalis. But the use of the faculty of reason in this rationalmode of regarding nature is either physical or hyperphysical, or, moreproperly speaking, immanent or transcendent. The former relates tonature, in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied inexperience (in concreto); the latter to that connection of the objectsof experience, which transcends all experience. Transcendent physiologyhas, again, an internal and an external connection with its object,both, however, transcending possible experience; the former is thephysiology of nature as a whole, or transcendental cognition of theworld, the latter of the connection of the whole of nature with a beingabove nature, or transcendental cognition of God.Immanent physiology, on the contrary, considers nature as the sum ofall sensuous objects, consequently, as it is presented to us—but stillaccording to à priori conditions, for it is under these alone thatnature can be presented to our minds at all. The objects of immanentphysiology are of two kinds: 1. Those of the external senses, orcorporeal nature; 2. The object of the internal sense, the soul, or, inaccordance with our fundamental conceptions of it, thinking nature. Themetaphysics of corporeal nature is called physics; but, as it mustcontain only the principles of an à priori cognition of nature, we mustterm it rational physics. The metaphysics of thinking nature is calledpsychology, and for the same reason is to be regarded as merely therational cognition of the soul.Thus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts:1. Ontology; 2. Rational Physiology; 3. Rational cosmology; and 4.Rational theology. The second part—that of the rational doctrine ofnature—may be subdivided into two, physica rationalis[81] andpsychologia rationalis. [81] It must not be supposed that I mean by this appellation what is generally called physica general is, and which is rather mathematics than a philosophy of nature. For the metaphysic of nature is completely different from mathematics, nor is it so rich in results, although it is of great importance as a critical test of the application of pure understanding—cognition to nature. For want of its guidance, even mathematicians, adopting certain common notions—which are, in fact, metaphysical—have unconsciously crowded their theories of nature with hypotheses, the fallacy of which becomes evident upon the application of the principles of this metaphysic, without detriment, however, to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of cognition.The fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessitydictates this division; it is, therefore, architectonical—in accordancewith the highest aims of reason, and not merely technical, or accordingto certain accidentally-observed similarities existing between thedifferent parts of the whole science. For this reason, also, is thedivision immutable and of legislative authority. But the reader mayobserve in it a few points to which he ought to demur, and which mayweaken his conviction of its truth and legitimacy.In the first place, how can I desire an à priori cognition ormetaphysic of objects, in so far as they are given à posteriori? andhow is it possible to cognize the nature of things according to àpriori principles, and to attain to a rational physiology? The answeris this. We take from experience nothing more than is requisite topresent us with an object (in general) of the external or of theinternal sense; in the former case, by the mere conception of matter(impenetrable and inanimate extension), in the latter, by theconception of a thinking being—given in the internal empiricalrepresentation, I think. As to the rest, we must not employ in ourmetaphysic of these objects any empirical principles (which add to thecontent of our conceptions by means of experience), for the purpose offorming by their help any judgements respecting these objects.Secondly, what place shall we assign to empirical psychology, which hasalways been considered a part of metaphysics, and from which in ourtime such important philosophical results have been expected, after thehope of constructing an à priori system of knowledge had beenabandoned? I answer: It must be placed by the side of empirical physicsor physics proper; that is, must be regarded as forming a part ofapplied philosophy, the à priori principles of which are contained inpure philosophy, which is therefore connected, although it must not beconfounded, with psychology. Empirical psychology must therefore bebanished from the sphere of metaphysics, and is indeed excluded by thevery idea of that science. In conformity, however, with scholasticusage, we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysics—but only asan appendix to it. We adopt this course from motives of economy; aspsychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as anindependent study, while it is, at the same time, of too greatimportance to be entirely excluded or placed where it has still lessaffinity than it has with the subject of metaphysics. It is a strangerwho has been long a guest; and we make it welcome to stay, until it cantake up a more suitable abode in a complete system of anthropology—thependant to empirical physics.The above is the general idea of metaphysics, which, as more wasexpected from it than could be looked for with justice, and as thesepleasant expectations were unfortunately never realized, fell intogeneral disrepute. Our Critique must have fully convinced the readerthat, although metaphysics cannot form the foundation of religion, itmust always be one of its most important bulwarks, and that humanreason, which naturally pursues a dialectical course, cannot do withoutthis science, which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and, byelevating reason to a scientific and clear self-knowledge, prevents theravages which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit inthe sphere of morals as well as in that of religion. We may be sure,therefore, whatever contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by thosewho judge a science not by its own nature, but according to theaccidental effects it may have produced, that it can never becompletely abandoned, that we must always return to it as to a belovedone who has been for a time estranged, because the questions with whichit is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity, and reason mustalways labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these, orto destroy those which others have already established.Metaphysic, therefore—that of nature, as well as that of ethics, but inan especial manner the criticism which forms the propædeutic to allthe operations of reason—forms properly that department of knowledgewhich may be termed, in the truest sense of the word, philosophy. Thepath which it pursues is that of science, which, when it has once beendiscovered, is never lost, and never misleads. Mathematics, naturalscience, the common experience of men, have a high value as means, forthe most part, to accidental ends—but at last also, to those which arenecessary and essential to the existence of humanity. But to guide themto this high goal, they require the aid of rational cognition on thebasis of pure conceptions, which, be it termed as it may, is properlynothing but metaphysics.For the same reason, metaphysics forms likewise the completion of theculture of human reason. In this respect, it is indispensable, settingaside altogether the influence which it exerts as a science. For itssubject-matter is the elements and highest maxims of reason, which formthe basis of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all.That, as a purely speculative science, it is more useful in preventingerror than in the extension of knowledge, does not detract from itsvalue; on the contrary, the supreme office of censor which it occupiesassures to it the highest authority and importance. This office itadministers for the purpose of securing order, harmony, and well-beingto science, and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to thehighest possible aim—the happiness of all mankind.Chapter IV. The History of Pure ReasonThis title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating adivision of the system of pure reason of which I do not intend to treatat present. I shall content myself with casting a cursory glance, froma purely transcendental point of view—that of the nature of purereason—on the labours of philosophers up to the present time. They haveaimed at erecting an edifice of philosophy; but to my eye this edificeappears to be in a very ruinous condition.It is very remarkable, although naturally it could not have beenotherwise, that, in the infancy of philosophy, the study of the natureof God and the constitution of a future world formed the commencement,rather than the conclusion, as we should have it, of the speculativeefforts of the human mind. However rude the religious conceptionsgenerated by the remains of the old manners and customs of a lesscultivated time, the intelligent classes were not thereby preventedfrom devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence and natureof God; and they easily saw that there could be no surer way ofpleasing the invisible ruler of the world, and of attaining tohappiness in another world at least, than a good and honest course oflife in this. Thus theology and morals formed the two chief motives, orrather the points of attraction in all abstract inquiries. But it wasthe former that especially occupied the attention of speculativereason, and which afterwards became so celebrated under the name ofmetaphysics.I shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which thegreatest changes in metaphysics took place, but shall merely give ahasty sketch of the different ideas which occasioned the most importantrevolutions in this sphere of thought. There are three different endsin relation to which these revolutions have taken place.1. In relation to the object of the cognition of reason, philosophersmay be divided into sensualists and intellectualists. Epicurus may beregarded as the head of the former, Plato of the latter. Thedistinction here signalized, subtle as it is, dates from the earliesttimes, and was long maintained. The former asserted that realityresides in sensuous objects alone, and that everything else is merelyimaginary; the latter, that the senses are the parents of illusion andthat truth is to be found in the understanding alone. The former didnot deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind ofreality; but with them it was merely logical, with the others it wasmystical. The former admitted intellectual conceptions, but declaredthat sensuous objects alone possessed real existence. The lattermaintained that all real objects were intelligible, and believed thatthe pure understanding possessed a faculty of intuition apart fromsense, which, in their opinion, served only to confuse the ideas of theunderstanding.2. In relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason, we findone school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience,and another that they have their origin in reason alone. Aristotle maybe regarded as the head of the empiricists, and Plato of thenoologists. Locke, the follower of Aristotle in modern times, andLeibnitz of Plato (although he cannot be said to have imitated him inhis mysticism), have not been able to bring this question to a settledconclusion. The procedure of Epicurus in his sensual system, in whichhe always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience, wasmuch more consequent than that of Aristotle and Locke. The latterespecially, after having derived all the conceptions and principles ofthe mind from experience, goes so far, in the employment of theseconceptions and principles, as to maintain that we can prove theexistence of God and the existence of God and the immortality of themobjects lying beyond the soul—both of them of possible experience—withthe same force of demonstration as any mathematical proposition.3. In relation to method. Method is procedure according to principles.We may divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiryinto the naturalistic and the scientific. The naturalist of pure reasonlays it down as his principle that common reason, without the aid ofscience—which he calls sound reason, or common sense—can give a moresatisfactory answer to the most important questions of metaphysics thanspeculation is able to do. He must maintain, therefore, that we candetermine the content and circumference of the moon more certainly bythe naked eye, than by the aid of mathematical reasoning. But thissystem is mere misology reduced to principles; and, what is the mostabsurd thing in this doctrine, the neglect of all scientific means isparaded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition. As regardsthose who are naturalists because they know no better, they arecertainly not to be blamed. They follow common sense, without paradingtheir ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret,how we are to find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well ofDemocritus.Quod sapio satis est mihi, non ego curo Esse quodArcesilas aerumnosiqueSolones. PERSIUS—Satirae, iii. 78-79. is their motto, under which they may lead a pleasant and praiseworthy life, without troubling themselves with science or troubling science with them.As regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method, they have nowthe choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical, whilethey are bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure. When Imention, in relation to the former, the celebrated Wolf, and as regardsthe latter, David Hume, I may leave, in accordance with my presentintention, all others unnamed. The critical path alone is still open.If my reader has been kind and patient enough to accompany me on thishitherto untravelled route, he can now judge whether, if he and otherswill contribute their exertions towards making this narrow footpath ahigh road of thought, that which many centuries have failed toaccomplish may not be executed before the close of the present—namely,to bring Reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which hasalways, but without permanent results, occupied her powers and engagedher ardent desire for knowledge.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON ***Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

Se planteó como objetivo el observar si los vectores densos obtenidos lograban captar la cercanía semántica que algunos términos de esta obra guardan unos con otros.\n",

Por ejemplo \"priori\" y \"posteriori\" están cercanos en el espacio obtenido, a pesar de que un conocimiento es a priori si y sólo si no es a posteriori.\n",
